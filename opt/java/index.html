Java is a operating system independent programming language, originally developed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>, meanwhile merged to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a>.



<h2>Installation</h2>
To install Java go to the download center of Oracle. If you want to develop for Java you need to install the <abbr title="Java Development Kit">JDK</abbr>, otherwise you just have to install the <abbr title="Java Runtime Environment">JRE</abbr>. I recommend to install it to  `/opt/java`  as root.

You can use  `galternatives`  (see <a href="/2012/04/galternatives/">here</a>) to tell your system that there's a JRE or a compiler. Point  `java`  and  `javac`  to the binaries of your installation, e.g. in  `/opt/oracle-java/jdk1.7.0_03/bin` .
