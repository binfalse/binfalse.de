This plugin improves Vim's support for editing R code and makes it possible to
integrate Vim with R.

It uses some ideas and code from Johannes Ranke's (vim-r-plugin), Eric Van
Dewoestine's (screen plugin), Vincent Nijs (R.vim for Mac OS X) and some ideas
from the Tinn-R (Windows only) project.

The latest version of this plugin is available at:

    <span class="Constant"><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628</a></span>

Feedback is welcomed. Please submit bug reports and feature requests to the
developers, we are very interested in what you like and what you would like to
see in future releases. Do not like a feature? Tell us and we may add an
option to disable it. Cryptic error message are bugs... Please report them.
The plugin should emit useful warnings if you do things it was not programmed
to deal with.

<span class="PreProc">3. Installation</span>
                                                       <span class="Constant">r-plugin-installation</span>

<span class="PreProc">3.1. General instructions I</span>

You need to activate plugins and indentation according to <span class="Type">'filetype'</span>. You
should have at least the following options in your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span>:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   set nocompatible</span>
<span class="Comment">   syntax enable</span>
<span class="Comment">   filetype plugin on</span>
<span class="Comment">   filetype indent on</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
Make a backup of your ~/.vim directory because existing files will be
replaced. Please, look at <span class="Identifier">r-plugin-files</span> to see the list of files.

<span class="PreProc">3.2. Operating system specific instructions</span>

<span class="PreProc">3.2.1. Unix (Linux, OS X, etc.)</span>

In addition to having R installed in your system, this plugin requires users
to install either:

   Conque Shell: <span class="Constant"><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2771">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2771</a></span>
   or screen: <span class="Constant"><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen">http://www.gnu.org/software/screen</a></span>

   <span class="Todo">Note:</span> The screen application is already packaged for most GNU/Linux
   distributions and other Unix variants. In fact, screen is installed by
   default on many Linux distributions.  Unfortunately, installation
   instructions for these dependencies vary widely and are beyond the scope of
   this documentation.

Uncompress the archive:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   unzip vim-r-plugin-*.zip -d ~/.vim</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
Start Vim and build the tags file for this document (and others that eventually
are in at the same directory):
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">  :helptags ~/.vim/doc</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
You may be interested in integrating the Vim-R-plugin with either screen.vim
plugin or Conque Shell plugin. See <span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_screenplugin</span> and
<span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_conqueplugin</span> for details.


<span class="PreProc">3.2.2. Windows</span>

In addition to having R installed in your system, this plugin requires users
to install several external dependencies:

<span class="Statement">    </span>* Vim's version must be &gt;= 7.3

<span class="Statement">    </span>* Python: <span class="Constant"><a href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a></span>
      <span class="Todo">Note:</span> Be careful to download the correct Python version because Vim
      needs a specific version of Python DLL. For example, the official Vim
      7.3 for Windows needs either Python 2.7 or 3.1. <span class="Todo">Note:</span> the official Vim
      is 32 bit and, thus, Python must be 32 bit too.

<span class="Statement">    </span>* pywin32: <span class="Constant"><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/</a></span>
      <span class="Todo">Note:</span> The default download may not match the Python version Vim was
      linked with. You have to &quot;View all files&quot; on the download page to find
      the file that matches the version of Python that you installed.

Create your <span class="Identifier">vimfiles</span> directory if you do not have it yet. Its path will be
similar to one of the following:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">  C:\Documents and Settings\yourlogin\vimfiles</span>
<span class="Comment">  C:\Users\yourlogin\vimfiles</span>

Uncompress the archive. Right click on the plugin's zip file and choose
&quot;Extract all&quot;. Then choose ~/vimfiles as the destination directory.

Start Vim and build the tags file for this document (and others that eventually
are in the same directory):
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">  :helptags ~\vimfiles\doc</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
Start R and try to send some lines from GVim to R Console. You may have to
adjust the value of <span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_sleeptime</span>.


<span class="PreProc">3.3. Troubleshooting (if the plugin doesn't work)</span>

The plugin is a <span class="Identifier">file-type</span> plugin. It will be active only if you are editing
a .R or .Rnw file. The menu items and tool bar buttons will not be visible and
the key bindings will not be active while editing either unnamed files or
files with name extensions other than .R or .Rnw. If the plugin is active,
pressing <span class="Special">&lt;LocalLeader&gt;</span>rf should start R (the <span class="Special">&lt;LocalLeader&gt;</span> is '\' by default).

Look at the ~/.vim (Linux, Unix, Os X) or ~/vimfiles (Windows) directory. Is
there a subdirectory named &quot;r-plugin&quot;? If not, then you unpacked the plugin in
the wrong place.

Did you see warning messages but they disappeared before you have had time to
read them? Type the command <span class="Identifier">:messages</span> in Normal mode to see them again.

Are you using Debian, Ubuntu or other Debian based Linux distribution? If yes,
you may prefer to install the Debian package available at:

   <span class="Constant"><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jalvesaq/vimrplugin">https://sites.google.com/site/jalvesaq/vimrplugin</a></span>


<span class="PreProc">3.4. General instructions II (optional steps)</span>

<span class="PreProc">update list of objects</span>

Start R and update the list of objects for omni completion and syntax
highlight (see <span class="Identifier">:RUpdateObjList</span> for details).


<span class="PreProc">customize the plugin</span>

Please, read the section <span class="Identifier">r-plugin-options</span>.


<span class="PreProc">hide unused buttons</span>

Edit Vim's toolbar and remove the buttons that you never use. The plugin adds
some buttons to the toolbar, but you may not see them because gvim has too
many buttons by default. Please see the page below to know how to hide buttons
on the toolbar:

   <span class="Constant"><a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Hide_toolbar_or_menus_to_see_more_text">http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Hide_toolbar_or_menus_to_see_more_text</a></span>


<span class="PreProc">install additional plugins</span>

You may be interested in installing additional general plugins to get
functionality not provided by this file type plugin. ShowMarks, snipMate, and
EnhancedCommentify are particularly interesting. Please read <span class="Identifier">r-plugin-tips</span>
for details.


<span class="PreProc">==============================================================================</span>
<span class="PreProc">4. Use</span>
                                                                <span class="Constant">r-plugin-use</span>

<span class="PreProc">4.1. Key bindings</span>

To use the plugin, open a .R or .Rnw or .Rd file with Vim and type \rf
(replace \ with the key used as <span class="Special">&lt;LocalLeader&gt;</span>). Then, you will be able to use
plugin key bindings to send commands to R.

This plugin has many key bindings, which correspond with menu entries and, in
some cases, toolbar buttons. In the list below, the backslash represents the
<span class="Special">&lt;LocalLeader&gt;</span> (see <span class="Identifier">maplocalleader</span>). Not all menu items and key bindings are
enabled in all filetypes supported by the plugin (r, rnoweb, rhelp):

  --------------------------------------------------------

Please see <span class="Identifier">r-plugin-key-bindings</span> to learn how to customize the key bindings
without editing the plugin directly, and <span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_underscore</span> to disable
underscore replacement.

After the command \ao, Vim will save the current buffer if it has any pending
changes, run &quot;R CMD BATCH --no-restore --no-save&quot; on the current file and show
the resulting .Rout file in a new tab. Please see <span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_routnotab</span> if
you prefer that the file is open in a new split window.  <span class="Todo">Note:</span> The command
\ao, silently writes the current buffer to its file if it was modified and
deletes the .Rout file if it exists.

R syntax uses &quot; &lt;- &quot; to assign values to variables which is inconvenient to
type. In insert mode, typing a single underscore, &quot;_&quot;, will write &quot; &lt;- &quot;,
unless you are typing inside a string. If necessary, it is possible to insert
an actual underscore into your file by typing a second underscore.  This
behavior is similar to the EMACS ESS mode some users may be familiar with and
is enabled by default.


<span class="PreProc">4.2. Edition of rnoweb files</span>

In Rnoweb files (.Rnw), when the cursor is over the @ character, which
finishes an R chunk, the sending of all commands to R is suspended and the
shortcut to send the current line makes the cursor to jump to the next chunk.
While editing rnoweb files, the following commands are available in Normal
mode:

   gn : go to the next chunk of R code
   gN : go to the previous chunk of R code


<span class="PreProc">4.3. Omni completion and the highlighting of functions</span>
                                                             <span class="Constant">:RUpdateObjList</span>
                                                          <span class="Constant">:RUpdateObjListAll</span>
The plugin adds some features to the default syntax highlight of R code. One
such feature is the highlight of R functions. However, only functions that
R loads by default are highlighted. To add functions of other libraries, you
should do the following:

  1. Start R from within Vim.
  2. Use R's library() to load the libraries whose functions you want
     highlighted.
  3. Run the following command in Vim's Normal mode:
     :RUpdateObjList

The command :RUpdateObjList in addition to creating a list of function names
to be highlighted also creates a file containing a list of objects for omni
completion (<span class="Identifier">compl-omni</span>) including all objects currently in R's workspace,
with the exception of the .GlobalEnv objects. These two lists are stored
permanently in the ~/.vim/r-plugin directory and one of them, &quot;omniList&quot;, is
also used by the Object Browser to show the contents of libraries.

The command  :RUpdateObjList  waits 120 seconds to R finish building the list.
If this time is not enough to your system, please, set a different value of
<span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_buildwait</span>.

You should run  :RUpdateObjList  whenever you upgrade R since some functions
are removed and new ones are added at each new R version.

The command  :RUpdateObjListAll  will tell R to load all installed packages
and, then, build the &quot;omniList&quot;.


<span class="PreProc">4.4. The Object Browser</span>

You have to do \ro to either start or updated the Object Browser. The Object
Browser has two views: .GlobalEnv and Libraries. If you either press <span class="Special">&lt;Enter&gt;</span>
or double click on the first line of the Object Browser it will toggle the
view between the objects in .GlobalEnv and the currently loaded libraries (but
only libraries loaded when <span class="Identifier">:RUpdateObjList</span> was run will be shown).

In the .GlobalEnv view, if an object has the attribute &quot;label&quot;, it will be
displayed in the Object Browser. The options <span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_open_df</span> and
<span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_open_list</span> control whether the elements of data.frames and lists
are shown. In the Object Browser window, while in Normal mode, you can either
press <span class="Special">&lt;Enter&gt;</span> or double click (GVim only) over a data.frame or list to
show/hide its elements (not if viewing the content of loaded libraries). If
you are running (G)Vim in an UTF-8 locale, unicode line drawing characters
will be used to draw lines in the Object Browser. This is the case of most
Linux distributions. If you are using Windows, ascii characters will be used,

In the Libraries view, you can either double click or press <span class="Special">&lt;Enter&gt;</span> over a
library to see its objects. The Object Browser goes down only one level in
lists. Thus, if a list has a sublist among its elements, the sublist elements
will not be shown. In the Object Browser, the libraries have the color defined
by the PreProc highlighting group, and the other objects have their colors
defined by the return value of some R functions. Each line in the table below
shows a highlighting group and the corresponding R function (if any) used to
classify the objects:

<span class="PreProc">         PreProc        libraries</span>
<span class="Constant">         Number         is.numeric()</span>
<span class="Constant">         String         is.character()</span>

Vim can jump to functions defined in other files if you press <span class="Special">CTRL-]</span> over the
name of a function, but it needs a tags file to be able to find the function
definition (see <span class="Identifier">tags-and-searches</span>). The command  :RBuildTags  call the R
function rtags() to build the tags file for the R scripts in the current
directory. Please read the <span class="Identifier">r-plugin-tips</span> to learn how to create a tags file
referencing source code located in other directories, including the entire R
source code.

<span class="PreProc">5. How the plugin works</span>
                                                        <span class="Constant">r-plugin-functioning</span>

<span class="PreProc">5.1. Omni completion</span>

Vim can automatically complete the names of R objects when <span class="Special">CTRL-X</span> <span class="Special">CTRL-O</span> is
pressed in insert mode (see <span class="Identifier">omni-completion</span> for details and <span class="Type">'completeopt'</span> to
know how to customize the <span class="Identifier">omni-completion</span>).  Omni completion shows in a pop
up menu the name of the object, its class and its environment (most
frequently, its package name). If the object is a function, its arguments are
shown in a separate window.

If a data.frame is found, while building the list of objects, the columns in
the data.frame are added to the list. When you try to use omni completion to
complete the name of a data.frame, the columns are not shown.  But when the
data.frame name is already complete, and you have inserted the '$' symbol,
omni completion will show the column names.

The file containing the list of objects used for omni completion is built by
the R function contained in the script ~/.vim/r-plugin/buil_omniList.R. This
function is sourced by R, which causes R to create the list used by Vim.

Vim uses two files: one for the objects of .GlobalEnv and the other for all
other objects. The .GlobalEnv list is stored in the /tmp/r-plugin-yourlogin
directory and, thus, is deleted after each reboot. The other file is stored in
~/.vim/r-plugin and remains available until you manually rebuild it with the
command: <span class="Identifier">:RUpdateObjList</span>.


<span class="PreProc">5.2. Communication through screen, without the screen plugin (Linux/Unix only)</span>

Vim and R run as independent processes. The main disadvantage is that we have
limited communication between the two applications: Vim can send strings to R
through screen and R can write files to be read by Vim. That's all.  The main
advantage is that Vim's or the plugin's bugs will not affect R.

The r-plugin uses screen to communicate with R. First, the plugin initiates a
new screen session and  uses this to start a new R process. The plugin's menu
options, toolbar buttons and key bindings can then be used to communicate with
the newly started R process. The plugin sends commands to R through screen. By
default, all Vim buffers share the same R process, but it is also possible to
configure Vim so that each buffer runs its own instance of R in a separate
terminal emulator. In this case, the screen sessions have unique names. The
names are made using the user name and the seconds of localtime(). Hence, a
name clash is possible if a single user starts more than one Vim buffer at the
same second. To change the default behavior and force all Vim buffers to use
different R processes see <span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_single_r</span>.

<span class="PreProc">6. Known bugs and workarounds</span>

<span class="PreProc">6.1. Indentation</span>

Correctly written code might be wrongly indented. Example:

   <span class="PreProc">this code                               is indented as:</span>
   if(T)                                   if(T)
     for(i in 1:2)                           for(i in 1:2)
     {                                       {
       cat(i, &quot;\n&quot;)                            cat(i, &quot;\n&quot;)
     }                                       }
   x                                         x


<span class="PreProc">6.2. R's source() issues</span>

The R's source() function prints an extra new line between commands if the
option echo = TRUE, and error messages and warning are printed only after the
entire code is sourced, which makes it more difficult to find errors in the
code sent to R.


<span class="PreProc">6.3. GVim's toolbar buttons, menu and title bar blink during omni completion</span>

The plugin unmakes the R menu and the related toolbar buttons when Vim leaves
the R buffer. During omni completion, Vim leaves the R buffer and goes to the
scratch window which is not recognized as an R file type. Consequently, the
plugin unmakes the toolbar buttons and R related menu items. If you prefer,
you can use the option <span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_never_unmake_menu</span> but, then, the menu and
tool bar buttons will never be deleted, even if you change from one file type
to another.


<span class="PreProc">6.4. R session is detached when GVim is closed (Linux/Unix only)</span>

If you launch GVim through a custom keyboard shortcut, the problem may be
solved if you add -f as parameter to GVim. The R session will also be detached
when GVim is closed if you launch GVim by the command line in a terminal
emulator, and, then, close the terminal-emulator. In any case, to reattach to
the R session, open a new terminal window and type:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   screen -r</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>

<span class="PreProc">6.5. The clipboard's content is lost (Windows only)</span>

On Windows, the plugin copies the command that will be sent to R into the
clipboard when not using the Conque Shell plugin.  Thus, if you have anything
in the clipboard it will be lost while using the plugin.


<span class="PreProc">6.6. The buffer name must be in the window title (Windows only)</span>

On Windows, when not using the Conque Shell plugin, the plugin tries to
activate the &quot;R Console&quot; window, paste the command that is being sent to R,
and, then, activate the GVim window. To activate the GVim window the plugin
requires that the name of the file being edited be in the GVim windows title.
This is the default on Vim if you have not set the option <span class="Type">'titlestring'</span>.


<span class="PreProc">6.7. The menu may not reflect some of your custom key bindings</span>

If you have created a custom key binding for the Vim-R-plugin, the menu in
GVim will not always reflect the correct key binding if it is not the same for
Normal, Visual and Insert modes.

<span class="PreProc">6.7. quit(save = &quot;yes&quot;) may not work properly</span>

If you are using either the Conque Shell plugin or the Screen plugin (and are
not running R in an external terminal), the R command quit(save = &quot;yes&quot;) may
not have time enough to save the workspace. Vim will sleep for 1 second after
the command \rw before killing R but this time is not enough for big
workspaces.

The plugin uses the first terminal emulator that it finds in the following
list:
    1. gnome-terminal,
    2. konsole,
    3. xfce4-terminal,
    4. iterm
    5. Eterm,
    6. rxvt,

If Vim does not select your favorite terminal emulator, you may define it in
your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span> by setting the variable vimrplugin_term, as shown below:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>

The Object Browser may be created in four different places: at the right/left
of the script windows or (if using Conque Shell) at the right/left of the R
Console window (see <span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_conqueplugin</span> for details on the use of Conque
Shell). By default, the Object Browser will be created with 40 columns at the
right side of the R Console. If Conque Shell is not being used, the Object
Browser will be at the right side of the script window. You can change the
Object Browser's default width and placement by putting different values in
your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span>, as in the examples below:

<span class="Comment">   let vimrplugin_objbr_w = 30</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
The minimum width of the Object Browser windows is 9 columns.

By default, the elements of data.frames are shown in the Object Browser, but
not the elements of other types of lists. You can put the following in your

<span class="Comment">   let vimrplugin_open_df = 0</span>
<span class="Comment">   let vimrplugin_open_list = 1</span>

<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   let vimrplugin_vimpager = &quot;no&quot;</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>

<span class="PreProc">7.4.2. Details and other options:</span>

The plugin key bindings will remain active in the documentation buffer, and,
thus, you will be able to send commands to R as you do while editing an R
script.  You can, for example, use <span class="Special">&lt;LocalLeader&gt;</span>rh to jump to another R help
document.

The valid values of vimrplugin_vimpager are:

   &quot;horizontal&quot;: Split the window horizontally.
   &quot;vertical&quot;  : Split the window vertically if the editor width is large
                 enough; otherwise, split the window horizontally and attempt
                 to set the window height to at least 20 lines.
                 This is the default.
   &quot;tab&quot;       : Show the help document in a new tab. If there is already a
                 tab with an R help document, use it.
   &quot;tabnew&quot;    : Show the help document in a new tab.
   &quot;no&quot;        : Do not show R documentation in Vim.

The window will be considered large enough if it has more columns than
vimrplugin_editor_w + vimrplugin_help_w. These variables control the minimum
width of the editor window and the help window, and their default values are,
respectively, 66 and 46.  Thus, if you want to have more control over Vim's
behavior while opening R's documentations, you will want to set different
values to some variables in your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span>, as in the example:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>

<span class="Comment">   let vimrplugin_by_vim_instance = 1</span>
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
The <span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_by_vim_instance</span> option requires that Vim is acting as a
command server because the variable <span class="Identifier">v:servername</span> is used to make the name of
the screen session which will run R. By default, GVim runs as server, but Vim
does not. Hence, if you are using Vim you have either to start Vim with the
argument --servername or use the screen.vim plugin which tries to restart Vim
with the --servername argument. If you want to use more than nine GVim
instances you will have to use the --servername argument because screen will
not differentiate between the names &quot;GVIM1&quot; and &quot;GVIM10&quot;.

<span class="PreProc">7.5.2 Using the Screen plugin</span>

Both options are ignored when using Vim in a terminal emulator and using

By default, each Vim buffer sends code to its own R process. You can set
<span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_by_vim_instance</span> value to 1 if you prefer that all buffers of each
(G)Vim instance sends code to the same R process.  When using the Conque Shell
plugin, there is no need of setting a Vim server because R will be running
inside a Vim's buffer, and, thus, Vim has direct access to R's input and
output.

<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   let vimrplugin_r_args = &quot;--sdi --no-save --quiet&quot;</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
On Linux, there is no default value for <span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_r_args</span>. On Windows, the
default value is &quot;--sdi&quot;, but you may change it to &quot;--mdi&quot; if you do not like
the SDI style of the graphical user interface.

By default, the R commands in .Rout files are highlighted with the color of
comments, and only the output of commands has some of its elements highlighted
(numbers, strings, index of vectors, warnings and errors). The same
highlighting scheme is applied to the R Console when using the Conque Shell
plugin to run R inside a Vim's buffer. For one hand, we do not need to
highlight R commands in the Console if they were sent by the plugin from an R
script buffer since we have the code highlighted in the script buffer and in
the Console we want to pay attention to the output. A too colorful
highlighting scheme would be distracting. On the other hand, if we were typing
commands directly in the Console it would be beneficial to have the R syntax
highlighted.

If you prefer that R commands in the R output are highlighted as they are in R
scripts, put the following in your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span>:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>

By default, Vim-R-plugin will use the screen.vim plugin if it is installed
unless Conque Shell plugin is installed too.  If you prefer to use both
Vim-R-plugin and screen plugin at the same time, download and install the
screen.vim from:

   <span class="Constant"><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2711">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2711</a></span>

Start Vim and do the command <span class="Special">&lt;LocalLeader&gt;</span>rf. The screen plugin will split the
terminal in two regions and will run R in one of them. Using both plugins at
the same time is especially useful for users who may prefer to use Vim and R
in a terminal emulator, rather than using the graphical interface provided by
GVim.

If you have the screen plugin installed but prefer do not integrate the it
with the Vim-R-plugin you will need to add the following to your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span>:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   let vimrplugin_screenplugin = 0</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
The screen.vim plugin also supports tmux, which allows you to split the
terminal vertically. Please read <span class="Identifier">screen-intro</span> and <span class="Identifier">screen-shell-vertical</span>
for details.  By default, the Vim-R-plugin will tell the screen plugin to
split the terminal horizontally. If you preffer to split it vertically,
install tmux and put in your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span>:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   let vimrplugin_screenvsplit = 1</span>
<span class="Comment">   let ScreenImpl = 'Tmux'</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
<span class="Todo">Note</span> that the second line is an option of the screen plugin and that it is
also possible to split the terminal vertically if using the correct version of
the screen application (see <span class="Identifier">screen-shell-vertical</span>).

<span class="Todo">Note:</span> Read the screen's documentation, especially the section <span class="Identifier">screen-gotchas</span>
(the E325 is caused by the presence of <span class="Type">'swapfile'</span>). This problem will not
happen if you start Vim from within a screen session, as in the example below.
However, when starting Vim from within screen you will not be able to start a
new R session after closing the first one with the \rq command. Moreover, you
will have to manually switch from one screen region to another and kill them.

A sample detachable session could be:

  - Start Vim through screen:
      screen vim theScript.R
  - Use Vim to start an R session:
      \rf
  - Send code from Vim to R, and, then, detach Vim and R with <span class="Special">&lt;c-a&gt;</span>d
  - Some time latter reattach the screen session:
      screen -r
  - Type <span class="Special">&lt;c-a&gt;</span>S to split the region, <span class="Special">&lt;c-a&gt;&lt;tab&gt;</span> to go the other region and
    <span class="Special">&lt;c-a&gt;</span>n until you get one region with Vim and the other with R.
  - When you have finished to use Vim and R close them and type exit to
    quit the screen session.

Here are several useful screen shortcuts:

  <span class="Special">&lt;c-a&gt;&lt;tab&gt;</span>        go from Vim to R and vice-versa
  <span class="Special">&lt;c-a&gt;</span>:resize <span class="Special">N</span>    set the height of the current window to <span class="Special">N</span> lines
  <span class="Special">&lt;c-a&gt;</span>n            switch to the next screen session
  <span class="Special">&lt;c-a&gt;</span>p            switch to the previous screen session
  <span class="Special">&lt;c-a&gt;</span>S            split the current region in two new ones
  <span class="Special">&lt;c-a&gt;</span>X            kill the current region

By default, screen waits briefly after it receives external commands and
other default options may not be what you want. Please read screen

<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
<span class="Todo">Note:</span> Nico Raffo's Conque Shell plugin is not perfect yet, but its use already
has some advantages: the ability to edit R's output, and the syntax
highlighting of the output. The three main problems of Conque Shell are due to
Vim limitations: the lack of a feature that may be called InsertCharPre event,
the impossibility of scrolling a buffer which is not being edited, and the use
of the same variable, <span class="Type">'updatetime'</span>, to do both save swap files and trigger
<span class="Identifier">CursorHold</span> events.

As a consequence of the first limitation, Conque Shell sometimes gets confused
while converting typed text to strings to be sent to the application running
in a Vim buffer. With the current version of Conque Shell (2.0), on Windows,
only ascii characters can be either sent to or typed in the Conque Term. On
Linux or other system whose encoding is UTF-8, characters of any encoding can
be sent to the Conque Term, but only Latin-1 characters can be typed directly
in the Conque Term.

The second limitation has a more obvious consequence: the shell buffer does
not scroll when there is new output but it is not the currently active buffer.
After a command is sent to the Conque buffer, the Conque Shell plugin waits
100 milliseconds (on Linux) or 200 milliseconds (on Windows) before reading
R's output. Longer values for the waiting time will increase the chances that
the output of R commands will be immediately shown in the R Console. To set a
different waiting time, change the value of vimrplugin_conquesleep in your
<span class="Identifier">vimrc</span> as in the example:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   let vimrplugin_conquesleep = 300</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
To manually scroll the R Console buffer, put the following in your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span>
(replace <span class="Special">&lt;F5&gt;</span> with your preferred key):
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   nmap &lt;F5&gt; :call RScrollTerm()&lt;CR&gt;</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
Then, you will be able to scroll the R Console buffer at any time by pressing the
<span class="Special">&lt;F5&gt;</span> key in Normal mode. Of course, you should replace <span class="Special">&lt;F5&gt;</span> with your
preferred key.

You may also want to put the following Conque options in your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span> (look at
the Conque Shell documentations for details):
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   let ConqueTerm_CWInsert = 1</span>
<span class="Comment">   let ConqueTerm_Color = 0</span>
<span class="Comment">   let ConqueTerm_ReadUnfocused = 1</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
<span class="Todo">Note:</span> The use of <span class="Identifier">ConqueTerm_ReadUnfocused</span> will set the value of <span class="Type">'updatetime'</span>

When creating custom key bindings for the Vim-R-plugin, it is necessary to
create three maps for most functions because the way the function is called is
different in each Vim mode. Thus, key bindings must be made for Normal mode,
insert mode, and visual mode.

To customize a key binding you should put in your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span> something like:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   nmap &lt;F2&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;RStart</span>
<span class="Comment">   imap &lt;F2&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;RStart</span>
<span class="Comment">   vmap &lt;F2&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;RStart</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
The above example shows how you can increase compatibility with old versions
of the Vim-R-plugin, by changing the key binding used to start R from
<span class="Special">&lt;LocalLeader&gt;</span>rf to the old default value, F2.

Only the custom key bindings for Normal mode are shown in Vim's menu, but you
can type <span class="Identifier">:map</span> to see the complete list of current mappings, and below is the

<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
The plugin also contains a function called RAction which allows you to build
ad-hoc commands to R. This function takes the name of an R function such as
&quot;levels&quot; or &quot;table&quot; and the word under the cursor, and passes them to R as a
command.

For example, if your cursor is sitting on top of the object called gender and
you call the RAction function, with an argument such as levels, Vim will pass
the command levels(gender) to R, which will show you the levels of the object
gender.

To make it even easier to use this function, you could write a custom key
binding that would allow you to rapidly get the levels of the object under
your cursor. Add the following to your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span> to have an easy way to pass R
the levels command.
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   map &lt;LocalLeader&gt;rk :call RAction(&quot;levels&quot;)&lt;CR&gt;</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
then (assuming that the leader key is &quot;\&quot;) if you type \rk R will receive the
command
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   levels(myObject)</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
You should replace <span class="Special">&lt;LocalLeader&gt;</span>rk with the key binding that you want to use
and &quot;levels&quot; with the R function that you want to call.

                                                               <span class="Constant">r-plugin-tips</span>

<span class="PreProc">10.1. Is it possible to stop R from within Vim?</span>

Sorry, it is not possible. You have to press ^C into R's terminal emulator.


<span class="PreProc">10.2. Html help and custom pager</span>

If you prefer to see help pages in a html browser, put in your ~/.Rprofile:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   options(help_type = &quot;html&quot;)</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
and in your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span> (see <span class="Identifier">vimrplugin_vimpager</span>):
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   let vimrplugin_vimpager = &quot;no&quot;</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>

<span class="PreProc">10.3. How do marked blocks work?</span>

Vim allows several marks (bookmarks). The most commonly used marks are the
lowercase alphabet letters.  If the cursor is between any two marks, the
plugin will send all of the lines between them to R.

To make it easier to remember where blocks begin and end, we recommended that
you use the ShowMarks plugin available at:

   <span class="Constant"><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=152">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=152</a></span>

This plugin makes it possible to visually manage your marks. You may want to
add the following two lines to your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span> to customize ShowMarks behavior:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   let marksCloseWhenSelected = 0</span>
<span class="Comment">   let showmarks_include = &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>

<span class="PreProc">10.4. Use snipMate</span>

You probably will want to use the snipMate plugin to insert snippets of code
in your R script. The plugin may be downloaded from:

   <span class="Constant"><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540</a></span>

The snipMate plugin does not come with snippets for R, but you can copy the
r.snippets that ships with the Vim-R-plugin (look at the r-plugin directory)
to the snippets directory. The file has only a few snippets, but it will help
you to get started. If you usually edit rnoweb files, you may also want to
create an rnoweb.snippet by concatenating both tex.snippets and r.snippets.


<span class="PreProc">10.5. Easier key bindings for most used commands</span>

The most used commands from Vim-R-plugin probably are &quot;Send line&quot; and &quot;Send
selection&quot;. You may find it a good idea to map them to the space bar in your
<span class="Identifier">vimrc</span> (suggestion made by Iago Mosqueira):
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   vmap &lt;Space&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;RDSendSelection</span>
<span class="Comment">   nmap &lt;Space&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;RDSendLine</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
You may also want to remap <span class="Special">&lt;C-x&gt;&lt;C-o&gt;</span>:

   <span class="Constant"><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2269005/how-can-i-change-the-keybinding-used-to-autocomplete-in-vim">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2269005/how-can-i-change-the-keybinding-used-to-autocomplete-in-vim</a></span>


<span class="PreProc">10.6. Remap the &lt;LocalLeader&gt;</span>

People writing Rnoweb documents may find it better to use a comma or other key
as the <span class="Special">&lt;LocalLeader&gt;</span> instead of the default backslash (see <span class="Identifier">maplocalleader</span>):
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   let maplocalleader = &quot;,&quot;</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>

<span class="PreProc">10.7. Use a tags file to jump to function definitions</span>

Vim can jump to a function definition if it finds a &quot;tags&quot; file with the
information about the place where the function is defined.  To generate the
tags file, use the R function rtags(), which will build an Emacs tags file.
If Vim was compiled with the feature <span class="Identifier">emacs_tags</span>, it will be able to read the
tags file. Otherwise, you can use the function etags2ctags() from the script
located at ~/.vim/r-plugin/etags2ctags.R to convert the Emacs tags file into a
Vim's one. To jump to a function definition, put the cursor over the function
name and hit <span class="Special">CTRL-]</span>. Please, read <span class="Identifier">tagsrch.txt</span> for details on how to use tags
files, specially the section <span class="Identifier">tags-option</span>.

You could, for example, download and unpack R's source code, start R inside
the ~/.vim directory and do the following command:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   rtags(path = &quot;/path/to/R/source/code&quot;, recursive = TRUE, ofile = &quot;RTAGS&quot;)</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
Then, you would quit R and do the following command in the terminal emulator:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   ctags --languages=C,Fortran,Java,Tcl -R -f RsrcTags /path/to/R/source/code</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
Finally, you would put the following in your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span>, inside an <span class="Identifier">autocmd-group</span>:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   autocmd FileType r set tags+=~/.vim/RTAGS,~/.vim/RsrcTags</span>
<span class="Comment">   autocmd FileType rnoweb set tags+=~/.vim/RTAGS,~/.vim/RsrcTags</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
<span class="Todo">Note:</span> While defining the autocmd, the RTAGS path must be put before RsrcTags.

Example on how to test whether your setup is ok:

   1. Type &quot;mapply()&quot; in an R script and save the buffer.
   2. Press <span class="Special">CTRL-]</span> over &quot;mapply&quot; (Vim should jump to &quot;mapply.R&quot;).
   4. Locate the string &quot;do_mapply&quot;, which is the name of a C function.
   5. Press <span class="Special">CTRL-]</span> over &quot;do_mapply&quot; (Vim sould jump to &quot;mapply.c&quot;).


<span class="PreProc">10.8. Fold setup</span>

Vim has several methods of folding text (see <span class="Identifier">fold-methods</span> and
<span class="Identifier">fold-commands</span>). To enable the syntax method of folding for R files, put in
your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span>:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   let r_syntax_folding = 1</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
With the above option, Vim will load R files with all folds closed. If you
prefer to start editing files with all folds open, put in your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span>:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   set nofoldenable</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
<span class="Todo">Notes:</span> (1) Enabling folding may slow down Vim. (2) Folding is not a file type
plugin option. It is a feature defined in syntax/r.vim.


<span class="PreProc">10.9. Automatically comment/uncomment code</span>

There are several plugins that make it easy to comment and uncomment code
(respectively, put and remove the '#' symbol from the begin of lines). One of
them is the EnhancedCommentify which allows us to comment/uncomment a line or
a block of lines with the command <span class="Special">&lt;Leader&gt;</span>x:

   <span class="Constant"><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=23">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=23</a></span>


<span class="PreProc">10.9. Run your Makefile from within R</span>

Do you have many Rnoweb files included in a master tex or Rnoweb file and use
a Makefile to build the pdf? You may consider it useful to put the following
line in your <span class="Identifier">vimrc</span>:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   nmap &lt;LocalLeader&gt;sm :update&lt;CR&gt;:call SendCmdToR('system(&quot;make&quot;)')&lt;CR&gt;</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>

<span class="PreProc">10.10. Group windows with compiz</span>

If you are using Compiz, it may be easier to work with the plugin if the
various related windows (editor, terminal, and graphics window) are grouped
because they will be raised together when one of them receives the focus.  You
may need CompizConfig Settings Manager installed to enable this feature (look
at the &quot;Window Management&quot; section for &quot;Group and Tab Windows&quot;).


<span class="PreProc">10.11. Why do I have to updated the Object Browser manually?</span>

It is because Vim and R run as separate processes and, thus, it is not
possible to Vim to know whether R is busy or not. If R was running as part of
the text editor, as happens with JGR and RKward, which are linked to libR.so,
it would be possible to wait for R to finish processing a command before
sending to it a command to rebuild the list of objects for the Object Browser.
This command should be sent after each line sent to R.  But if the
Vim-R-plugin did this, the use of Vim would be blocked until R finished its
processing.


<span class="PreProc">10.12. Edit your ~/.Rprofile</span>

You may want to edit your ~/.Rprofile. Two common options are the use of GVim
as the text editor and the use of html help. Example for Linux:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   if (interactive()) {</span>
<span class="Comment">     local({</span>
<span class="Comment">       options(editor = 'gvim -f -c &quot;set ft=r&quot;')</span>
<span class="Comment">       options(help_type = &quot;html&quot;)</span>
<span class="Comment">     })</span>
<span class="Comment">   }</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
and for Windows:
<span class="Ignore">&gt;</span>
<span class="Comment">   if (interactive()) {</span>
<span class="Comment">     local({</span>
<span class="Comment">       options(editor = '&quot;C:/Program Files (x86)/Vim/vim73/gvim.exe&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;set filetype=r&quot;')</span>
<span class="Comment">       options(help_type = &quot;html&quot;)</span>
<span class="Comment">     })</span>
<span class="Comment">   }</span>
<span class="Ignore">&lt;</span>
