message: "Thanks for the post, it was very useful to me. But when i tried to implement
  it i ran into some trouble because the scroll bar wouldn't follow the incoming data.
  It turned out that i had to add to the current position the value of the visible
  part of the scroll bar like: \n\n\n{% highlight java %}\nint currentpos\t=vbar.getValue()
  \ +vbar.getVisibleAmount();\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\n Once i did this it worked
  just fine. Thanks again for the post."
