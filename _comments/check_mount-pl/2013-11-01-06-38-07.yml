message: "Hello.\nFirst of all thank you for supplying very nice plugin though.\n\nI'm
  the newbie of using nagios.\nI'd like to suggest you how about to change the line
  number 14\nfrom  `use utils qw(%ERRORS); ` \nto  `use Nagios::Plugin qw(%ERRORS);`
  \n\nDevelopment doc says that  `utils.pm`  is gonna deprecated soon or later."
