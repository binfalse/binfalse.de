Your display font doesn't seem include the n-dash – Halbgeviertstrich – which once was the European standard for separating parenthetical expressions. In this regard moderncv's use to denote a relationship is unobjectionable and esthetically pleasing.\n\nMy guess is most systems would display that character correctly – even Windows since their Unicode display fonts have been fairly comprehensive for many years now and the n-dash is far from being uncommon. I use the Ubuntu font on all of my devices, so I can't speak to that.\n\nIt puzzles me though that your KDE fails at such a simple display issue.
