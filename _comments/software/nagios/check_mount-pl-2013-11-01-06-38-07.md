Hello.
First of all thank you for supplying very nice plugin though.

I'm the newbie of using nagios.
I'd like to suggest you how about to change the line number 14
from  `use utils qw(%ERRORS); ` 
to  `use Nagios::Plugin qw(%ERRORS);` 

Development doc says that  `utils.pm`  is gonna deprecated soon or later.
