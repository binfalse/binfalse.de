comment: "Hello.\nFirst of all thank you for supplying very nice plugin though.\n\nI'm the newbie of using nagios.\nI'd like to suggest you how about to change the line number 14\nfrom  `use utils qw(%ERRORS); ` \nto  `use Nagios::Plugin qw(%ERRORS);` \n\nDevelopment doc says that  `utils.pm`  is gonna deprecated soon or later."
