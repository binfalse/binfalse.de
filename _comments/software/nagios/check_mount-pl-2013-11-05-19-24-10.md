Where did you read that  `utils.pm`  is going to be deprecated? The website of that perl module <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~tonvoon/Nagios-Plugin-0.34/lib/Nagios/Plugin.pm" rel="nofollow">Nagios::Plugin</a> links to the <a href="https://www.nagios-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html" rel="nofollow">guidelines</a> in which they recommend the usage of  `utils.pm` .
