Hi

I'm strugging to set this plugin up. I can execute it correctly from the CLI but nrpe is showing  `NRPE: Unable to read output` 



{% highlight bash %}
[root@fc-web04 libexec]# /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_mount.pl -m /var/Performance
/var/Performance is mounted!
{% endhighlight %}



This is the error I'm getting 



{% highlight bash %}
[root@fc-web04 libexec]# ./check_nrpe -H localhost -c check_df
NRPE: Unable to read output
{% endhighlight %}



Can you pls guide me how could I make it work ?

Thanks in advance
Liju
