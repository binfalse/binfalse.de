comment: "Hi Antonio,\n\nthere is already a button for integration to the toolbar, see figure 1 of this article. If you need help to integrate it feel free to <a href=\"{{ site.url }}/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ping me</a>.\nI like the idea of a key-shortcut, maybe I'll implement it in the next version.\n\nThanks a lot,\nMartin"
