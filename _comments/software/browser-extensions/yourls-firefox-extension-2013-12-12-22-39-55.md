comment: 'When selecting a sentence prior to clicking "Shorten", and the sentence contains whitespaces, the whitespaces are stripped. I would like them to be replaced by ''-'', and all upper cases to be replaced by lowercases. Similar to soundcloud and in line with common practice elsewhere. What''s your opinion?'
