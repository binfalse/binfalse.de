Hi there-

This is fantastic!  Two quick questions for you.  :)

1. Am I understanding it correctly that the customization comes after the toolbar is installed?  

2. If so...  As I understand it, this would be no bueno for public installations.  Is there a way to adapt this in such a way that we could, say, offer the extension to download from our website for other people to use?

Thanks and best wishes,
Kristen

That's a very cruel authorization method you got going there, btw...
