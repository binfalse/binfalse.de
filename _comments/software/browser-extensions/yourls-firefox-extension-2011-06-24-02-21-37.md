comment: "Hi there-\n\nThis is fantastic!  Two quick questions for you.  :)\n\n1. Am I understanding it correctly that the customization comes after the toolbar is installed?  \n\n2. If so...  As I understand it, this would be no bueno for public installations.  Is there a way to adapt this in such a way that we could, say, offer the extension to download from our website for other people to use?\n\nThanks and best wishes,\nKristen\n\nThat's a very cruel authorization method you got going there, btw..."
