comment: "Hey, nice job. Love this little plugin. I'd like to make a suggestion if you don't mind.\n\nCould there be an option to be able to turn off the dialog box that comes up with the confirmation if it succeeds, and just have the statusbar/toolbar icon change in appearance for a few seconds? EG: having a checkmark appear over it for 5 seconds?  I think that it'd make the workflow a bit quicker for users. I almost didn't notice that it auto-copied to clipboard because I was checking for the link while the dialog box was open.\n\nAnother feature that would improve the plugin would for a right click context on the status/toolbar icon/button, which would allow the user to access the settings dialog. I was a stumped for a couple of moments, before realizing that I could setup the plugin via the addons page. Itâ€™s a bit unintuitive for some users, as most new addons present the setup on the first-run, or via right click on the new icon the addon provides."
