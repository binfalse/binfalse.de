comment: "Hi RD,\n\nthanks a lot for sharing your experiences!\nI just implemented some of your ideas in version 1.3 and submitted it for the review. I think it will stay there for about one month, but the extension is already available at http://s.binfalse.de/ffextv.\nYour pieces of advice were very useful, so thank you very much indeed!\n\nHave a nice day,\nMartin"
