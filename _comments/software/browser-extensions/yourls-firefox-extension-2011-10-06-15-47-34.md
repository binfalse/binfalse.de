Hi RD,

thanks a lot for sharing your experiences!
I just implemented some of your ideas in version 1.3 and submitted it for the review. I think it will stay there for about one month, but the extension is already available at http://s.binfalse.de/ffextv.
Your pieces of advice were very useful, so thank you very much indeed!

Have a nice day,
Martin
