comment: "Hi Ludo,\n\nthe plugin is available for FF6 since August 21, 2011. You'll find it <a href=\"http://s.binfalse.de/ffextv\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\nUnfortunately it has to get reviewed by the dev-team of Mozilla before you'll find it on it's main page (or in the search results). I submitted the plugin for review on August 21, but it's still waiting for a review in the queue. (Currently it's on position 56 of 241, after ~1 month!!). As long as it's in this queue I cannot do anymore than waiting (and hoping that Mozilla extends it's dev-team to fit it's extremely shortened release cycles).\n\nI hope this answer helps,\nMartin"
