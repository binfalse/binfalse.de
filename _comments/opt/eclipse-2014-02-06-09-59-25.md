Thank you for this post. I was looking for Eclipse through google when I was bumping your article here. I also ha some trouble with the version from Debian: unstable so I gave your recommendation a try. I have to admit, that there are still some problems, probably because I am not an expert on Java and new to this subject. Still I'm lucky that I have found a way now to change the editor style though they really could have made that easier...
