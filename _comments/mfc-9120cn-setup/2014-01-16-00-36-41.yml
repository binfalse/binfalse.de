message: 'Hi,


  Did you experiment with "scan-to-email"? The scanner lets me set an smtp server
  and test that, even a POP3 account for _receiving_ mail. It sends out test mail
  correctly.


  I just want to be able to push a button on the thing to send an email, but that
  functionality doesn''t seem to be available without proprietary software on Win
  or Mac. Or is it? Would be really great for my mother. She is not very computer
  literate and has no ambition to change that.'
