Hi, Thanks for an interesting and well written post. I consider the same printer myself, but have found many forum posts indicating that it is not at all straightforward to get this up and running on linux..

How come this works well when the printer is not listed by Cups compatible devices?

Where did you find proof in your research before buying, that this would work in linux?

kind regards,
