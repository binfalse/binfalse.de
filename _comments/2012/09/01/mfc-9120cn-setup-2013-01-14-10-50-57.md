comment: "Hi, Thanks for an interesting and well written post. I consider the same printer myself, but have found many forum posts indicating that it is not at all straightforward to get this up and running on linux..\n\nHow come this works well when the printer is not listed by Cups compatible devices? \nhttp://www.cups.org/ppd.php\n\nWhere did you find proof in your research before buying, that this would work in linux?\n\nkind regards,\natle weibell"
