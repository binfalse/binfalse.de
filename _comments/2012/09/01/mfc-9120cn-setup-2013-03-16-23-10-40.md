Of course I cannot give you any guarantees, but as far as I can say it will work the same way. In my article I explained how to use the scan and the print function via network. Since cups also comes with drivers for the MFC-9320CW (<em>Brother MFC-9320CW BR-Script3 (en)</em> and <em>Brother MFC-9320CW Foomatic/Postscript (en)</em>) I think you'll be able to print out of the box. The 9320CW is also able to scan to file, so my above described workaround will probably also be successful for you.

I don't know how to use the printer via USB, but I wouldn't expect big issues to setup the printer in your network :)

Please let me (and other people reading this solution) know whether everything is fine with your new device.
