Hi Atle,

yes, unfortunately I'm quite familiar with such driver issues... That's the reason why I bought a network printer. I'm sure you'll have a hard time to setup the scanner to operate via USB, but since this device supports the <strong><em>"scan-to"</em> mail, FTP, or CIFS</strong>, it's pretty easy to set it up.
And regarding the drivers for printing, before I bought the printer I searched for drivers and fortunately <strong><a href="http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=contents&keywords=9120CN&mode=filename&suite=testing&arch=any" rel="nofollow">Debian</a> as well as <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?searchon=contents&keywords=9120CN&mode=filename&suite=quantal&arch=any" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu</a> already include drivers for the MFC-9120CN</strong>. But brother itself also provides drivers for CUPS. You'll find it in the Brother Solutions Center or simply click this link: <strong><a href="http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html#MFC-9120CN" rel="nofollow">MFC-9120CN drivers for linux</a></strong>.

I hope you'll have some fun with your printer. In case of trouble feel free to drop me a mail ;-)
