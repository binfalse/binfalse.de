Hi,

Did you experiment with "scan-to-email"? The scanner lets me set an smtp server and test that, even a POP3 account for _receiving_ mail. It sends out test mail correctly.

I just want to be able to push a button on the thing to send an email, but that functionality doesn't seem to be available without proprietary software on Win or Mac. Or is it? Would be really great for my mother. She is not very computer literate and has no ambition to change that.
