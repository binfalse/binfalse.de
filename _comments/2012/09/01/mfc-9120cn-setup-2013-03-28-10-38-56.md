comment: 'Hi Nick, nice to hear that! How is there is problem with printing in B&W? AFAIK it''s the same as for every other printer. You can configure the printer to print B&W in cups or in the application you''re using (depends on the application, but in most cases it can be configured using the properties button in the print-dialog)'
