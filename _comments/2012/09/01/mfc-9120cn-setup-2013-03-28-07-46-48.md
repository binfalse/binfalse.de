comment: "I got the MFC-9320CW and got it working as a printer over wireless so far. CUPS gave me two automatically detected printers to choose from, one had a dnssd URL and one had an lpd URL. I couldn't get the dnssd one to work at all but the lpd one works fine.\n\nThe working url is lpd://Brother/BINARY_P1\n\nTo try scanning next.\n\nAlso, how do I get it to do B&amp;W? I don't always want to print in colour!"
