message: "Hi. My name is Hylke Koers and I work on MathJax. Thanks for your interest
  and your kind words about MathJax!\n\nI wanted to point out that we have recently
  launched a CDN service which makes it even easier to use MathJax. In most environments,
  you just include a link to the CDN in the HTML header and you're ready to include
  MathML or LaTeX in your posts. More info on the CDN is available at http://www.mathjax.org/2011/03/15/news/mathjax-launches-cdn-service-with-1-1-release/
  and specific instructions on using MathJax with popular platforms, including WordPress,
  can be found at http://www.mathjax.org/docs/1.1/platforms/index.html  \n\nHope that's
  useful."
