comment: "It's a very bad Idea setting Xms to 1024M or 10G. When you're starting two or three java-programs, the system-memory is nearly done. Normal users don't have more than 4 or 8 GB RAM. Unnormal users know how big java'instances of the used programs are at most and they know this parameters. \n\nSomething else: on Google's Android up to 2.2 the Xmx parameter is fixed to 16 MB or 32 MB, when you're using manufactors operatingsystem. If you have Cyanogen Mod or something else you can set it up to 64 MB at most.\n\nPS: good Denglisch^^"
