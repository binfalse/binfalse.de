comment: "When I execute within R the command  `library(RODBC)`  it works.\nI just see I have  `/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RODBC/libs/RODBC.so`  (I suppose that is the library is required).\nWhat is the  `JRI.jar`  version you are using? I have not got the  `parseAndEval`  method.\nThanks again"
