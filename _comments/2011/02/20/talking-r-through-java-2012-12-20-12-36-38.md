comment: "Hi,\nis there a way to get error messages from R back?\n\n- CODE EXAMPLE:\nRengine rEngine = new Rengine(new String [] {\"--vanilla\"}, false, null);\nrEngine.eval(\"library(xts)\");\nrEngine.assign(\"arrayValue\", DOUBLE DATA);\nrEngine.assign(\"arrayDates\", DOUBLE DATA);\nrEngine.eval(\"test = xts(arrayValue, order.by=arrayDates)\");\n\nThe last statement not only takes 1 minute to run, it also seems to fail (no test variable is created)\n-&gt; Is there a way to get some log information?\n\nThank you and best regards!"
