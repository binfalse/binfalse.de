comment: "Dear George,\nThe post of Using JRI , R with NetBeans in Windows was an excellent guide. I am using Eclipse IDE and trying to call R via a Java program using JRI. \nI have gone through your post and tried to replicate the same thing in Eclipse IDE. I am yet to get a successful output out of the java program (TestR.java). Here is what I did:\n1. Set R_Home variable =&gt; R_HOME = D:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.14.0\n2. Set PATH variable =&gt; PATH = D:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.14.0\\bin\\x64;(contains R.dll) D:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.14.0\\library\\rJava\\jri; (containsJRI.dll,JRI.jar,JRIEngine, REngine), D:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.14.0\\library\\rJava\\jri\\x64 (contains JRI.dll)\n3. Added -Djava.library.path=D:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.14.0\\library\\rJava\\jri\\ to the VM arguments, and I executed the program and it gave the following error:\n\"Could not find the main class: Files\\R\\R-2.14.0\\library\\rJava\\jri\\. Program will exit. \""
