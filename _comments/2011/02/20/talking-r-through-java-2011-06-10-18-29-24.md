greetings, I have a problem big problem, when I try to execute those steps, all work fine until the IDE configuration, I explain me better, I had installed Rjava, I had copied JAR requested, I had updated the environment variables in /etc/environment and until there all works configurate correctly, I work in Netbeans but I didn't know if I had to do any configuration in the IDE. Finally when I run the program, it appear this "cannot find system Renviron". Really I had tried all the possible things but I couldn't fix it. Sorry for my english, and I will appreciate any help that you can give to me for understand why is the reason of my problem. Thanks
