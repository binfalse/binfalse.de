comment: "Greetings,\nNow my Java-R connection works, I can make some calculus. But I do not know how I can use R's libraries like RODBC through Java, I tried with:   `re.eval(\"library(RODBC)\")` , that did not work. Can you help me to use this library? How can I test the library is actually loaded?\nThanks"
