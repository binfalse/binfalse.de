Hi jesslim,

if you're working on Linux/Unix just open a terminal and export the variable with



{% highlight bash %}
export R_HOME=/usr/lib64/R
{% endhighlight %}



Afterwards you can start Netbeans in the same session with the command



{% highlight bash %}
netbeans
{% endhighlight %}



If you're using Windows I'm sorry, but I'm not able to help you. I'm sure there is some possibility to set this variable in your user-profile, but I recommend to ask someone who is more familiar with Windows ;-)

Kind regards,
Martin
