comment: "Hi jesslim,\n\nif you're working on Linux/Unix just open a terminal and export the variable with\n\n\n\n{% highlight bash %}\nexport R_HOME=/usr/lib64/R\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\n\nAfterwards you can start Netbeans in the same session with the command\n\n\n\n{% highlight bash %}\nnetbeans\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\n\nIf you're using Windows I'm sorry, but I'm not able to help you. I'm sure there is some possibility to set this variable in your user-profile, but I recommend to ask someone who is more familiar with Windows ;-)\n\nKind regards,\nMartin"
