comment: "Hi Ray, thanks for your interest :)\nUnfortunately, I have no idea what might be wrong with your code. Especially if you do not publish it.. Moreover, it's been some time that I developed this small piece of code. Thus, the R packages probably have changed their behavior?\nI hope someone else is able to help you."
