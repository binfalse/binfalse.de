comment: "Very detailed Benchmark, especially the choice of the media and plaintext files, nice. For the future I'am sure I will frequently use this site, to choose the optimal compression algorithm.\n\nBut I have to add a note: In the rare case I send compressed files to windows users, I use the 7z container. 7z also uses the lzma algorithm and is free software, too. \n\nwin: http://7z.org\nunices: http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/\nand available in the Debian,grml an Ubuntu repository."
