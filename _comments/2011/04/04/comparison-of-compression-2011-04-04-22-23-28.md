Very detailed Benchmark, especially the choice of the media and plaintext files, nice. For the future I'am sure I will frequently use this site, to choose the optimal compression algorithm.

But I have to add a note: In the rare case I send compressed files to windows users, I use the 7z container. 7z also uses the lzma algorithm and is free software, too. 

win: [http://7z.org](http://7z.org)
sources: [http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/](http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/)
and available in the Debian,grml an Ubuntu repository.
