comment: "I recommend 7z, it uses LZMA algorithm, but adds checksums and archiving capabilities.   This adds a little to the overhead, but saves you from having to use tar for archinving, and gives you the reliability of built-in checksums.\n\nAs for single files that you don't need checksums on, I recommend LZMA.\n\nAs a note, many of these algorithms you can push further with command line options that most archivers use the default options.  This is because, the higher-compression options can take exponentially longer and use more computer resources for only a small gain, and some of them can be very memory and/or processor intensive to decompress."
