The Rumpel solution is like the syntax in other languages. &amp;&amp; is the bitwise operator und &amp; ist the logical operator. The behavior with vectors is specific for the languages. I think matlab has a similar syntax. You need more languages in your head. I need a bag with english knowledge :P
