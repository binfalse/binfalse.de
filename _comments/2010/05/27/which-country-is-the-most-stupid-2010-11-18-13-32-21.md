Hey dante,

I'm a studying Bioinformatics, most of the software I'm using is probably written by myself.
During my education I learned some algorithms to analyze such expression data. I met this guy to learn how these scientists produce the data and to get some normalized measurements from real experiments.
So I can't really recommend any software, but if you are interested in the tools that this medic uses, just tell me and I'll ask him.
Otherwise if you are interested in techniques to analyze this data from the perspective of a computer scientist please feel free to <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact/" rel="nofollow">contact me</a>!

Regards,
Martin
