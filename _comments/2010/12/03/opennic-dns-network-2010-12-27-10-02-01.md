Thank for benchmarking my dns: 217.79.186.148 :)\n\nYes, normally you will never be able to beat the providers DNS in a perfect setup. In DNS the response time of the network is very important, thats why google-dns/opendns will never be as fast - except if they really stock up their anycast (which I believe google can still do better than opendns).\n\nThe only reason, why I still never would recommend using the providers default DNS, is that they are not very reliable. You will see downtimes on \"heise.de internet monitor\" all the time. And since a year or so many decided to put ads on NXDOMAIN.\n\nAnyways, my DNS should be pretty fast for people using Alice/Unitymedia especially in NRW Area - because they get mostly routed via DÃ¼sseldorf - where my DNS-Server is located.\n\nI am planning next year some hardware upgrades and IPv6 - so maybe then I can even beat your provider DNS ;)
