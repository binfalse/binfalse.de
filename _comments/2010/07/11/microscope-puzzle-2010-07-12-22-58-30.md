Intermediate results (in beer per person):

Martin S. (leader): 12
Micha: 6.5 and a noalcoholic
Maria: 3
Christoph R.: 2.5
Norman: 2

Ok, seems to reflect the real alcohol consumption per person..
Well, it looks like you are not able to solve the last ones, here are some more hints:

C: You'll find it in the kitchen.
O: It's some food and is called like an Austrian city
Q: Cools down the hardware...
3: Part of a fruit.

So try to grab the last four beers!!
