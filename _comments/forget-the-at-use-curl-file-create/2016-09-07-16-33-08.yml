message: "Hi Frank,\n\n\nthe `$post` variable is only an associative array. Thus,
  you should be\nable to simply add whatever you want to send. Let's assume you have
  an\narray called `$image_paths` that contains the paths to images, then you\nmay
  do something like  `for ($i = 0; $i < count($image_paths);  ++$i) $post[\"upload-$i\"] = curl_file_create ($image_paths[$i]);` and afterwards send the the `$post` contents as usual.\nDoes
  that help?\n\n\n\nBtw, the function is called `curl_file_create` ;-)"
