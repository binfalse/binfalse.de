message: Comparison is unfair and biased towards **gzip**/**bzip2**, because you first
  used tar (practically to join all files into single big file). Other archivers compress
  each file independently, so they cannot gain an advantage of similarities between
  files (but they allow you to unpack any file or remove/replace files without repacking
  the whole archive). If you use tar as the first step for all other archivers as
  well, results will be much more fair. Rar has a special option `-s` (solid archive)
  which allows you to use inter-file compression. From your tests it seems that similarities
  between files can affect the result pretty much (especially for `/var/log` content
  and source code).
