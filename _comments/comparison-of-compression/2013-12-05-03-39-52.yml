message: 'I recommend 7z, it uses LZMA algorithm, but adds checksums and archiving
  capabilities.   This adds a little to the overhead, but saves you from having to
  use tar for archinving, and gives you the reliability of built-in checksums.


  As for single files that you don''t need checksums on, I recommend LZMA.


  As a note, many of these algorithms you can push further with command line options
  that most archivers use the default options.  This is because, the higher-compression
  options can take exponentially longer and use more computer resources for only a
  small gain, and some of them can be very memory and/or processor intensive to decompress.'
