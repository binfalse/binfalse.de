Great suggestion to use a proxy with Tiny Tiny Rss. I am running a some sort of cluster with Tiny Tiny Rss on [TinyTinyRss.com](http://TinyTinyRss.com/) and it made all very fast by using the proxy. Honestly I tweaked a lot more and using MariaDb Galera clusters, Nginx Reverse Proxy, Varnish Accel., and many more to keep it fast. But other suggestions are always welcome of course.

Enjoy your day and thanks!
