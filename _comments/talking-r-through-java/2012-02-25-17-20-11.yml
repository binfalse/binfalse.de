message: 'Hi jesslim,


  if you''re working on Linux/Unix just open a terminal and export the variable with




  {% highlight bash %}

  export R_HOME=/usr/lib64/R

  {% endhighlight %}




  Afterwards you can start Netbeans in the same session with the command




  {% highlight bash %}

  netbeans

  {% endhighlight %}




  If you''re using Windows I''m sorry, but I''m not able to help you. I''m sure there
  is some possibility to set this variable in your user-profile, but I recommend to
  ask someone who is more familiar with Windows ;-)


  Kind regards,

  Martin'
