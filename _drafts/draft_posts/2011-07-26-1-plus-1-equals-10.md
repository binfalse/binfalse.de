Some days ago we had lunch at the canteen, while a geek came across wearing a lousy t-shirt: <a href="http://www.getdigital.de/products/1plus1">1+1=10</a>. One of us, wlog the one w/o a beard, was very confused. How can 1 + 1 equal 10? It's 2, isn't it?


<h2>Explanation for dummies</h2>
This equation is of course wrong for the decimal system. So you can't sell two eggs for the price of ten (even if lot's of people try to). But it's correct for binary numeral system. What are binary numbers?
The decimal system knows 10 digits: 0 to 9. But wait, what comes after 9? Of course you know, you restart counting with 0, adding a 1 in front of it: 10, 11 etc. And what comes after 19? Adding 1 to the front position and restart at zero: 20, 21, 22..
But for binary numbers there are only two digits available! So again we start with 0, followed by 1. What comes next? There is no 2! so we have to start again with 0, adding 1 to the front. That means after 1 comes 10. Further counting brings us 11, and the next number is? 100, fine! Last position starts again with 0, adding 1 to the front. But there is no 2, so second position also restarts at 0, adding 1 to the front.
Here you can see the numbers zero to twelve in both systems:

     02    0010
     03    0011
     04    0100
     05    0101
     06    0110
     07    0111
     08    1000
     09    1001
     10    1010
     11    1011
     12    1100
{% endhighlight %}



<h2>Bit more sci please</h2>
In the decimal system each digit of a number is represented as something to the power of ten. The last digit is multiplied with zero to the power of ten, the next is multiplied with one to the power of ten and so on. Summing up everything will result in your number.
So 1337 is $$1\\cdot10^3 + 3\\cdot10^2 + 3\\cdot10^1 + 7\\cdot10^0 = 1000 + 300 + 30 + 7$$
