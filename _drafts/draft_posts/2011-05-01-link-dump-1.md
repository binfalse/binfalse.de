<blockquote>
[user2] they collect so much data
[user1] true
[user2] all connected devices return values sent to sony server
[user2] example:
[user3] user2: Debug models of course
[user2] >32” TFT-TVOEMreleasecex
[user4] i cannot find my PS3 connect to host with ‘updptl’ in the name
[user2] returns tv, fw version, fw type, console model
[user2] also i found data it collects when i had usb device attached etc etc
> snip <
[user2] another funny function i found is regarding psn downloads
[user2] its when a pkg game is requested from the store
[user2] in the url itself you can define if you get the game free or not. requires some modification in hashes and so on tho
[user3] ..
[user2] is like
[user8]
[user3] my god
[user2] drm:off
[user5] lol
[user2] lol
[user1] :facepalm:
> snip <
[user2] btw u know the login url for auth is like:
[user2] &serviceid=IV0001-NPXS01001_00&loginid=MYMAIL&password=MYPASS&first=true&consoleid=MYID
> snip <
[user12] I consider apache 2.2.15 old
[user2] which server
[user12] it also has known vulnerabilities
> snip <
[user11] yes, but their general attitude towards security just seems…ugh
[user2] sony wont misuse the info i bet xD
