I have a new hobby: hunting electromagnetic radiation; in wavelengths of 380mm < &Lambda; < 740mm. Yes, you got it, I bought a camera! But since light is quite fast taking pictures is not that easy :-)

<h2>The Cam</h2>
I decided for the 
d5100 old model, cheap, same sensor as d7000
d5200 new model, expensive. some features (wifi adapter), more pixels, more pics/s
d7000 old model, bigger, 


<h2>First Tests</h2>
was visiting parents and sistor on usedom
took ~1K pictures, most are crap, just to get used to it and to test some things
might be too small, but ok, not heavy


<h2>Gallery</h2>
want to share some of my pictures
don't want to spam you with photos, blogs aren't supposed to be photo galleries
some of you use flickr, also considered picasa and such services, all have draw backs, space limited, only see a small number of recent pictures etc.
need to pay money to get more
but i own servers and i have enough space for some photos, so i evaluated some standalone gallery software
piwigo is great! huge community, lots of themes and plugins, installation is even easier than wordpress
also comes with a nice style for mobile devices
is very sophisticated

my photos are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License, so if you like them feel free to use them in your projects, but make sure to indicate that they are taken by me!

so, let's see whether i'm able to fill this gallery with cute pictures :-)
but you probably won't see any faces, unless the people gave their ok...




any suggestions to improve my ... are welcome :)
