My name is **Martin Scharm** from Rostock, doing my PhD at the [Dept. of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics](http://www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/) at the [University of Rostock](http://www.uni-rostock.de/). I am keen on programming and administrating linux\|unix systems and I like information. And that is what this site is about.
<!--One of my special interests is programming and administration.-->

This blog is about my work, studies and life! Here I jot down some notes about what I just learned to not forget about it right away. It's something like a collection of various stuff concerning bioinformatics, hacking, and\|or $stuff.
