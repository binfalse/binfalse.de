I am Martin Scharm from Rostock, doing my PhD at the <a href="http://www.uni-rostock.de/">University of Rostock</a>. One of my special interests is programming and administration.

This blog is about my work, studies and life! Here I jot down some notes about what I just learned to not forget about it right away. It's something like a collection of various stuff concerning bioinformatics and some hacking. The content on this website is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0</a>. Most of the software I developed is assembled in repositories at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>. Some of these projects have their own repositories, smaller scripts and programs are collected in a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pipapo/">scratch repo</a>. Let free software rule the world!
