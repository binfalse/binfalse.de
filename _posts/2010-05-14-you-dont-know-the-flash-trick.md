Just sitting around with <a href="http://0rpheus.net/">Micha</a> on a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/virtualization/oraclevm/061984.html">SunRay</a> (maybe meanwhile OracleRay?). He is surfing through the web until his session seems to hang and he said:

<blockquote>
Fuck FLASH!! Need the flash-trick...
</blockquote>

I didn't heard about that trick before, but now he told me that feature.

If <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/flash/">Flash</a> kills your SunRay session you have to type  `Ctrl+Alt+Moon` , relogin and your session will revive. With running Flash!

As far as I know this happens very often when he is using his browser because unfortunately the whole web is contaminated with this fucking Flash... The Flash-Trick is very nice, but a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/433/">flashblock plugin</a> would be more user friendly!?
