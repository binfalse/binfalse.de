This year I started on a new journey in the [SAP](https://www.sap.com) biz.
To get a better feeling for the SAP ecosystem, I wanted to experiment and mess around on my own.
o avoid disrupting others and to have full control without needing to ask for permissions, I decided to set up an SAP system locally. For quite some time...
However, that turned out to be quite a challenge, especially when aiming for a proper (v)host setup.
After numerous attempts, I eventually found a reliable way using Docker.
Here's a rough guide based on my experience.


#### Prerequisites

Before diving into the setup, ensure you're technically ready:

- **Disk Space**: At least 100GB, but I'd recommend at least 200GB.
- **RAM**: They suggest 32GB. I have 250GB, and it's been running smoothly ;-)
- **CPU**: A couple of fast cores.
- **Time**: Everything SAP related requires patience and time.


#### Step 1: Start the SAP System using Docker

The easiest way to get started is by using the Docker image provided by SAP. You'll find it at the docker hub [sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial](https://hub.docker.com/r/sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial). As described on the docker hub readme, run the following command to start a container:

```bash
docker run --stop-timeout 3600 -it --name a4h -h vhcala4hci -p 3200:3200 -p 3300:3300 -p 8443:8443 -p 30213:30213 -p 50000:50000 -p 50001:50001 --sysctl kernel.shmmni=32768 sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial:ABAPTRIAL_2022_SP01
```

#### Step 2: Setting Up a Virtual Box for the SAP GUI

While I believe it would be possible to install the SAP GUI directly on your host, I recommend using a virtual environment to guard your host system. From my experiments I learned that SAP software loves to mess around in your file system and it will be virtually impossible to clean that up..

1. **Create a VM**: I used a Debian virtual box for this purpose.
2. **Install Java**: I've been successful with OpenJDK 17.

#### Step 3: Install SAP GUI for Java

1. **Download SAP GUI for Java**: Get it from [SAP's trial ](https://developers.sap.com/trials-downloads.html).
2. **Install on the VM**: Copy the downloaded rar archive to your virtual machine, unpack it (eg. using unrar) and run the [JAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)) file to start the installation:
    ```bash
    java -jar PlatinGUI-Linux-x86_64-7.80rev7.jar
    ```

4. **Start SAP GUI**: `cd` into the install location (probably `~/SAPClients/SAPGUI/bin`) and run:
    ```bash
    ./guistart /H/x.x.x.x/S/3200
    ```
    Replace `x.x.x.x` with the IP address that resolved to your host machine. Depending on your VM config, it might be something like `10.0.2.2` (VBox NAT) or maybe something starting with `192.168...`.

#### Step 4: Updating the License

Follow the procedure from the Docker Hub to update the license:

1. Login on client `000` as `SAP*` with the password `ABAPtr2022#01`.
2. Run Transaction `SLICENSE`.
3. Get a license from [minisap](https://go.support.sap.com/minisap/#/minisap). Choose `A4H`, fill the form, and download the license.
4. Back in the `SLICENSE` transaction in SAP GUI, click install and choose the downloaded file.
5. Log off from the `SAP*` account (`System -> Logoff`) and start a new SAP GUI session. Login on client `001` as `DEVELOPER` with the same password `ABAPtr2022#01`.

And that's it! You should now have a locally running SAP system. This setup allows you to experiment and develop in a controlled environment without affecting a main system. Happy coding <3
