It's corona-time and so many things are unclear.
Yet, I decided to quit my permanent position at the University of Rostock and try something new o.O

So I just started my own company!
The current logo is a paper boat and I already crafted a first draft of a website at [CODE&nbsp;AHOI.de](https://codeahoi.de), so strangers can find my new business ;-)

I would like to use my expertise to support organisations and the local economy.
And I would like to convince them to go for high quality and open source!
Especially for public institutions: [Public Money? Public Code!](https://publiccode.eu/)

The plan is to also blog about current jobs, ideas, and IT solutions over there at [https://codeahoi.de/news_en/](https://codeahoi.de/news_en/).
Those articles will be multilingual in German and English.
Blogging in German will be an exciting adventure itself...
However, I may copy the English version into this blog if I assume that it may be of interest for readers of this blog.


So if you're curious or if you're in need of a motivated developer and engineer, go and check out **CODE AHOI!**
And tell your peers ;-)
