Before anyone thinks I'm hibernating, I've just soo much to do, so there is no time to maintain this blog... Just don't know what to do first.

This week I had a presentation, topic was "Modeling of Overflow Metabolism in Batch and Fed-Batch Cultures of <em>Escherichia coli</em>". I also had to submit a study, with the headline "Modeling and evaluation of the dynamic behavior of a fermentation by simulation", that among others analyzes the dependencies of the ratio of product concentration versus biomass concentration on biological parameters.
Additionally this week I finished a work for a friend at the <a href="http://www.uni-magdeburg.de/">Otto-von-Guericke-Universit√§t Magdeburg</a>. He has to evaluate x-rays taken at a new detector and I developed a tool that does the trick.

As if that were not enough time consuming I'm still working on my project work, next week I have to present it in a research seminar (fortunately in German).

The reason I write this article, tomorrow is the so called <a href="http://www.wissenschaftsnacht-halle.de/">Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften</a> (translated by Google: <em>Long Night of Science</em>). Here the different departments of the university are presenting what they are doing, comprehensible for the public. In this event we have also a slot dealing with <a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/">SUN Spots</a> where I'm presenting some cool stuff I've programmed. Planed are a some introductions what Spots are and what they can do, and of course some demos. Among others we are playing with the light sensor and visualize a sunrise and a sunset, we demonstrate how one can regulate a fan depending on the temperature measured with a Spot (to induce a higher temperature a candle is planed, I hope everything will be well and the Spot won't melt away!). Of course some basic demos are shown, like AirText or the BouncingDemo, and last but not least it is time to play. I have prepared a labyrinth that has to be solved by various people against each other (up to seven people at a time in the same labyrinth, just limited by the number of available Spots), and also I also developed a control system for the game <a href="http://blobby.sourceforge.net/">Blobby Volley</a> to navigate the Blobbies with a Spot, maybe you've heard about it ;)
We also wanted to build a little car to drive around a little bit, but I'm not such engineer so this car isn't finished...

If you are bored and don't know what to do tomorrow visit this presentation!! It's at 8.30 am in room 3.31 at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=von+seckendorffplatz,+06120+halle&oe=utf-8&client=iceweasel-a&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Von-Seckendorff-Platz,+West+06120+Halle+(Saale),+Sachsen-Anhalt,+Germany&ei=hO8sTMTpKsnKONj2gJMJ&ved=0CBgQ8gEwAA&z=16">Von-Seckendorff-Platz 1</a>.

Maybe I publish all the code when there is a little bit time to write some comments and how-to's.

So you see, I'm very busy at the moment. If anyone has nothing to do, just notify me, I'll give you something to work on!
