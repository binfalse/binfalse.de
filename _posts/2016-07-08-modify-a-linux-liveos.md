By default I'm using GRML when I need a live operating system. I installed it to one of my USB pen drives and (almost) always carry it with me.
GRML already has most of the essential and nice-to-have tools installed and it's super compfortable when the shit has hit the fan!

## The Problem

However, there are circumstances when you need something that's not available on the base image.
That entails a bit annoying work. For example if you need to install package *XXX* you need to

* run `aptitude install XXX`
* recognize that the package lists are super out-dated...
* call `aptitude update`
* recognize you're missing the latest GPG key that was used to sign the packages
* run a `gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv YYY` followed by a `gpg --export YYY | sudo apt-key add -`
* run `aptitude install XXX` again to get the package

And that's actually really annoying if you nedd *XXX* often. You'll wish to have *XXX* in the base system! But how to get it there?

## Update the ISO image

The following will be based on GRML. I assume that your USB pen drive will be recognized as `/dev/sdX` and the partition you (will) have created is `/dev/sdX1`. The following also requires `syslinux` to be installed:

{% highlight bash %}
aptitude install syslinux
{% endhighlight %}


### Install the original Image to your Pen Drive

To modify an image you first need the image. So go to [grml.org/download/](http://grml.org/download/) and download the latest version of the image. At the time of writing this article it is Grml 2014.11 (Gschistigschasti). You see it's a bit outdated, wich also explains this article ;-)

To install it on a pen drive you need a pen drive. It should have a partition with a [*bootable* flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_flag). Use, eg., [fdisk](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/fdisk_partitioning.html) or [gparted](http://gparted.org/display-doc.php%3Fname%3Dhelp-manual).
This partition should have a FAT partition on it. If your not using the UI of gparted this is the way to go (assuming `/dev/sdX1` is the partition you created):

{% highlight bash %}
mkfs.fat -F32 -v -I -n "LIVE" /dev/sdX1
{% endhighlight %}

Then you need to install syslinux' MBR onto the pen drive:

{% highlight bash %}
dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr/mbr.bin of=/dev/sdX
{% endhighlight %}

Mount both, the ISO (`/tmp/grml96-full_2014.11.iso`) and the pen drive (`/dev/sdX1`) to copy all files from the ISO onto the pen drive:

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir -p /mnt/mountain/{iso,usb}
mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/mountain/usb
mount -o loop,ro -t iso9660 /tmp/grml96-full_2014.11.iso /mnt/mountain/iso
rsync -av /mnt/mountain/iso/* /mnt/mountain/usb/
{% endhighlight %}

If you now have a look into the `/mnt/mountain/usb/` directory you will see the GRML live image structure. However, you won't be able to boot -- you still need a proper bootloader.
Fortunately, the `syslinux` tool is able to install it to your pen drive:

{% highlight bash %}
syslinux /dev/sdg1
{% endhighlight %}

The syslinux bootloader still need some configuration, but GRML alreay contains them. Just copy them from the USB's`/boot/isolinux/` into the *root* of the pen drive:

{% highlight bash %}
cp /mnt/mountain/usb/boot/isolinux/* /mnt/mountain/usb
{% endhighlight %}

Excellent! Unmount the pendrive an try to boot from it, to make sure it's properly booting the GRML operating system:

{% highlight bash %}
umount /mnt/mountain/iso/ /mnt/mountain/usb/ && sync
{% endhighlight %}


### Understand what happens

{% include image.html align='alignright' url='/assets/media/pics/2016/grml-splash.png' img='/assets/media/pics/2016/grml-splash.png' title='GRML splash screen' caption='GRML splash screen' maxwidth='300px' %}

Ok, if that was successful you're mashine will boot into the GRML splash screen (see Figure) and you can choose between the 64bit and the 32bit version (and some more specific boot options).
Clicking either of them will mount a read-only file system from the pen drive as a read-write file system into your RAM.
Afterwards it will boot from that sytem in the RAM.

The file system that's written to the memory can be found in `live/grml64-full/grml64-full.squashfs` (or `/mnt/mountain/usb/live/grml32-full/grml32-full.squashfs` for 32bit systems).
It's a `squashfs`, see [wikipedia on SquashFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS).


### Modify the Base Image

So let's go and modify the system.
You probably alreay guess it: We need to update the `grml64-full.squashfs` and integrate the desired changes.
As I said, the image of the file system can be found in `/live/grml64-full/grml64-full.squashfs` and `/live/grml32-full/grml32-full.squashfs` of the USB's root.
In the following I will just use the 64bit version in `/live/grml64-full/grml64-full.squashfs`, but it can be applied to the 32bit version euqivalently -- just update the paths.

As the SquashFS is read-only you need to mount it and copy all the data to a location on a read-write file system.
Let's assume your pen drive is again mounted to `/mnt/mountain/usb` and `/storage/modified-livecd` is mounted as RW:

{% highlight bash %}
mount /mnt/mountain/usb/live/grml64-full/grml64-full.squashfs /mnt/mountain/iso -t squashfs -o loop
rsync -av /mnt/mountain/iso/* /storage/modified-livecd/
{% endhighlight %}

Now you have your system read-write in `/storage/modified-livecd`. Go ahead and modify it! For example, create a new file:

{% highlight bash %}
echo "this was not here before" > /storage/modified-livecd/NEWFILE
{% endhighlight %}

Then you just need to delete the original SquashFS file and repack the new version onto the pen drive:

{% highlight bash %}
rm /mnt/mountain/usb/live/grml64-full/grml64-full.squashfs
mksquashfs /storage/modified-livecd /mnt/mountain/usb/live/grml64-full/grml64-full.squashfs
{% endhighlight %}

Voil√†... Just boot from the pen drive and find your modified live image :)

Of course you can also `chroot` into `/storage/modified-livecd` to e.g. install packages and modify it from inside...
For those not familiar with chrooting: [Wikipedia comes with a good example on how to chroot.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot#Linux_host_kernel_virtual_file_systems_and_configuration_files


## So... Conclusion?

Yeah, it's not that hard to modify the system, but it takes some manual steps.
And if you plan to do it more often you need to think about infrastructure etc.
Thus, this is probably just applicable for hard-core users -- but those will love it ;-)
