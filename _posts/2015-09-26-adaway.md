Using [AdAway](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.adaway) on your [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29) phones it is very easy to block a set of URLs.


[AdAway](http://www.adaway.org/) ([available from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.adaway), [source from GitHub](https://github.com/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway)) is an ad-blocker. The application basically maintains a list of resources containing lists to ad-servers, see figure for example, e.g.:

    # dest ip   url
    127.0.0.1   some.ad.server.com

This entry will redirect all traffic meant for `some.ad.server.com` to the server `127.0.0.1`, which is your [localhost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost#Name_resolution). Entries from different resources are merged. Thus, all requests to typical ad-servers will fail &rarr; annoying advertisements won't be delivered. It's quite powerful and gives impressive results.
However, I didn't want to talk about ad-stuff. The cool thing is

## AdAway allows for extensions with own hosts files!

You can simply add another link to a file containing further host entries. I created my own AdAway file, uploaded it to [https://stuff.lesscomplex.org/adaway.txt](https://stuff.lesscomplex.org/adaway.txt) and added it to AdAway, as you can see in the figure. The current version contains a few entries for:

* facebook/yahoo/etc: I'm not using facebook or stuff, all these request shouldn't leave my phone
* captive portal detection: To detect captive portals the phone downloads a few bytes from a google server and checks if it is able to access the *real* internet or just a [captive portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal)
* swift key: I'm using swift key, but do not want it to communicate to the internet. Thus, I'm blocking a few URLs that swiftkey wants to talk to. As I'm already using a firewall this just adds another layer of privacy.

Feel free to use my "extension", but I expect it to change over time. :)

## Shortcomings

This method only works if applications load contents from URLs. As soon as the IPs are hard-coded the hosts file
