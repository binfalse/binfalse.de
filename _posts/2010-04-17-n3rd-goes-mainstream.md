Neither hallucinations nor does anybody drugged your coffee, what you see is real!

I leave my old self-made blog and move to the content management system <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> due to various reasons. My schedule doesn't allow profound modification to get some important features that Wordpress gives me for free. Behind this solution a lot of developer are working on this open source project and there are a huge bunch of plugins and for probably any problem Wordpress and its plugin developers offers a solution.

The layout is chosen to be simple and clear, just like my previous blog, and important: It is valid!
Maybe by the time I'll port some of the older entries to this new blog, to get them listed between search results.

There is on additional improvement. I'll try to overcome my inner pigdog lack of will power and compose some articles in English. I hope it will tweak my language abilities. If you find some mistakes, please correct me!

So, lets start!
