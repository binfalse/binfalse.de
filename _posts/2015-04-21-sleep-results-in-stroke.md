At least the risk for a stroke increases, according to a publication by [Leng *et al.*](http://lib.lesscomplex.org/lib/authors/Y. Leng) in [Neurology](http://lib.lesscomplex.org/lib/publishers/Neurology), 2015:
[Sleep duration and risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke: A prospective study and meta-analysis](http://lib.lesscomplex.org/lib/view/leng2015a). They studied the association between sleep duration and stroke incidence in a British population.
More than 9k study participants were asked about their habits of sleeping, afterwards the authors of the study recorded who of them had a stroke, for about 9 years.  
This study showed, that participants who sleep more than 8 hours a day are 46% more likely to get a stroke than those who sleep 6-8 hours.

It's not yet clear whether there is a causal connection or just a correlation, but I found that *potentially* interesting. Is a longer sleep already a sign for a bad health condition? Even worse, is sleep a reason for a stroke?
