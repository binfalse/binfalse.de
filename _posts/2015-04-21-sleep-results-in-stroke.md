At least the risk for a stroke increases, according to a publication by [Leng *et al.*](http://lib.lesscomplex.org/lib/authors/Y. Leng) in [Neurology](http://lib.lesscomplex.org/lib/publishers/Neurology), 2015:
[*Sleep duration and risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke: A prospective study and meta-analysis*](http://lib.lesscomplex.org/lib/view/leng2015a) \[Leng2015\]. They studied the association between sleep duration and stroke incidence in a British population.

More than 9k study participants were asked about their habits of sleeping, afterwards the authors of the study recorded who of them had a stroke, for about 9 years.  
This study showed, that participants who sleep more than 8 hours a day are 46% more likely to get a stroke than those who sleep 6-8 hours:

> Those with short sleep had an 18% increased stroke risk (not statistically significant), while long sleep was associated with a 46% increase in stroke risk after adjustment for conventional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and comorbidities. 

It's not yet clear whether there is a causal connection or just a correlation, but I found that *potentially* interesting. Is a longer sleep already a sign for a bad health condition? Even worse, is sleep a reason for a stroke?
