Who doesn't know, yesterday was your wife's birthday and you didn't bought some flowers yet!? Sounds like trouble, but these days are gone!


Some days ago I read an article at <a href="http://www.chruetertee.ch/blog/archive/2010/10/02/kalender-auf-der-kommandozeile-verwenden.html">chruetertee.ch</a> about the <a href="http://www.bsd.org/">BSD</a> tool <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=calendar&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+8.1-RELEASE&format=html">calendar</a>. I immediately realized, that this tool is the answer to one of my biggest questions: How to remember all the dates!?

Today I found some time to implement a small bash script that sends mails based on the output of the calendar tool. So it helps you remembering this periodical stuff.

On the <a href="/software/snippets/unforgotten/">software page for this script</a> you can learn how to use it. It is more than simple ;-)

Now I need to collect all important dates, so if YOU want me to wish you all the best at your birthday you have to leave a comment or write me an email!
