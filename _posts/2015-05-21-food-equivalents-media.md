I've just been listening to a podcast from [DRadio Wissen](http://dradiowissen.de/): [HÃ¶rsaal](http://dradiowissen.de/hoersaal/) (German podcast streaming lectures). I particularly like the podcast of DRadio. This time the lecture was held by  [Fabian Hemmert, a German design researcher, who was talking about the smartphones' future](http://dradiowissen.de/beitrag/smartphones-aber-bitte-mit-gef%C3%BChl). Quite interesting thought in there, but what I actually wanted to jot down was his comparison between food and social media. He tried to find food equivalents in media:

### The equivalent of *Fat is Fiction!*
Invented/fictional things -- easy to consume, but not a good base. And too much of it and you'll often have unnecessary ballast at the end of the day.

### The equivalent of *Sugar is Approbation!*
Everyone likes to hear approvals and confirmation, it's music to your ears. But too much of it is also unhealthy.

### The equivalent of *Protein is Truth!*
Not too easy to digest, but an important thing to base on.

### We are very short on Attention
He also notes that attention is the scarcest resource. Everyone wants us to pay attention and we want everyone to pay attention..


I kind of like the idea! Any other equivalences you can think of?
