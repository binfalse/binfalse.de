As I announced in my <a href="/2010/12/created-an-ai-for-a-contest/">previous article</a>, I took part in a contest. And, what should I say, I'm one of the six best programmer - worldwide!


Ok, ok - the contest has just started, there aren't any results yet, but <a href="http://www.freiesmagazin.de/20101220-dritter-programmierwettbewerb-beendet">they already announced</a> only six bots are facing off.
It's a pity that there aren't more people taking place in this game, but however, the lesser opponents the easier it is to conquer a place on the podium :-P

Good luck for everyone participating!
