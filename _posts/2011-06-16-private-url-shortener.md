In times of microblogging you all should have heard about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening">URL shortener</a>. There are a dime a dozen. The bad thing about public shortener: They are tracking everything... So why not installing your own one!?



There are a lot of shortener available out there, e.g. <a href="http://get-shorty.com/">shorty</a>, <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2009/08/17/less_n">lessn</a>, <a href="http://rod.gs/about/source">open URL shortener</a>, <a href="http://briancray.com/2009/08/26/free-php-url-shortener-script/">PHP URL shortener</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phurl/">phurl</a>, or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kissabe/">kissabe</a>, just to name some of them. Of course you can also <a href="http://www.sean-o.com/blog/index.php/2009/08/11/tutorial-how-to-create-your-own-url-shortener/">create your own</a> one.
I took a look at some of these tools and decided for <a href="http://yourls.org/">YOURLS</a>. It's very easy to install and comes with a nice <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>. I thought about providing this service for the public, but unfortunately the public always tend to exploiting these good deeds...

Of course I have some further intentions to use such a shortener, but you'll read about it in some further articles ;-)

By the way, if you think about using YOURLS with <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> you should take a look at <a href="https://blog.3dfxatwork.de/2011/06/yourls-mit-postgresql/">Matthias</a>' article (GER). He explains the setup and provides a patch, not that trivial as one might expect :-P

Go out and shorten the f$cking long internet!
