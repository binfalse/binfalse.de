Ladies and gentlemen, waiting is finally over. I'm proud to introduce Rumpel!


After more than one year of high frequently power of persuasion he finally set up his own blog named <a href="http://users.informatik.uni-halle.de/~ruttkies/RforRocks/">RforRocks</a>. A few minutes after release there are even lots of myths surrounding the origin of that name. May it stand for:



{% highlight bash %}
'R'umpel
'F'rees
'O'rdinary
'R'abbits
a'R'ested
'O'n
'C'astros
'K'nockout
'S'chools
{% endhighlight %}



Who knows? Me not! So try to grill Rumpel about this issue. And by the way, he's in any case worthy to follow ;-)
<small>(so Rumpel, time for my payoff)</small>
