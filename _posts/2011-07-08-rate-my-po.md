...sts (of course!). Yesterday I just installed a rating plugin, inspired by these <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">stackexchange</a> platforms.



Searching through the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">WordPress plugin directory</a> didn't make me happy. All existing plugins lack of desired features. After some tests I decided to modify <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/updownupdown-postcomment-voting/">UpDownUpDown</a> of <a href="http://davekonopka.com/">Dave Konopka</a>. It's a nice plugin, but still didn't match my criteria. For example guests were not allowed to vote, there were some XHTML bugs and I didn't like the style. So I created a <a href="https://github.com/davekonopka/UpDownUpDown/pull/1">patch</a> (it's attached..) and sent it to Dave (I don't yet have a github account). He told me that he'll take a look at it and might apply it to the official plugin, so if you also want to use this rating plugin with my additional features just keep the URL in mind and watch out for a new version.

The special version I'm using here right now has of course some more slight changes, to have it perfectly matched to my own blog.
So you are now able to vote for articles, positive or negative, to give me a hint what my visitors like to read ;-)

I additionally installed a further page that lists my articles sorted by votes: <a href="/top/">top</a>. So you can get a smart overview of best/worst content.

With this in mind: Happy voting! ;-)
