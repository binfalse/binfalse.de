As I <a href="/2010/12/created-an-ai-for-a-contest/">announced</a> I took place in a programming contest organized by <a href="http://www.freiesmagazin.de/dritter_programmierwettbewerb">freiesMagazin</a>. In the end I'm proud to tell you I'm second!


I still explained my <a href="/2010/12/fm-contest-tactics/">tactics</a> and my <a href="/2010/12/fm-contest-mappings/">map parsing</a> and all in all <a href="/2010/12/yeah-top-ten/">five other programmers</a> joined this contest. Today the editorial staffs announced the <a href="http://www.freiesmagazin.de/20110109-gewinner-des-dritten-freiesMagazin-programmierwettbewerbs">results</a>:

<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr><th>Ranking</th><th>Programmer(s)</th><th>Score in 2500 games</th></tr>
<tr><td>1.</td><td>Demel and Keiblinger</td><td class="tab-right">232.595,79</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.</td><td>Scharm</td><td class="tab-right">104.412,12 </td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td><td>Kirsch</td><td class="tab-right">98.675,43 </td></tr>
<tr><td>4.</td><td>Pirra</td><td class="tab-right">97.129,97 </td></tr>
<tr><td>5.</td><td>Robbert</td><td class="tab-right">75.739,36 </td></tr>
<tr><td>6.</td><td>Schulz</td><td class="tab-right">35.854,39 </td></tr>
</tbody></table>

You see I wasn't able to obtain half of the points of Demel and Keiblinger, looking to the results for each game there was no chance for my bot to beat them. But nevertheless I won the second rank! I couldn't find any contact information of these guys so I wasn't able to congratulate personally but if they read this article: <strong>Nice work guys</strong> ;-)
Of course congratulations to the other programmers, even if you didn't win, taking place is what counts!

By the way the organizer informed me about an  `IndexOutOfBoundsException`  in  `de.binfalse.martin.fmcontest.map.DMap.dirTo(DMap.java:192)` , so that my bot quit working 17 times. But I won't update my code since it has no sence beyond this contest... It's just to inform you.

Last but not least my thanks goes to the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(115, 115, 115);">freies</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">Magazin</span> itself. It was a very nice contest and I'm really happy about the voucher! I still have a good idea what to buy :-P

P.S.: Since both programmers on the first rank should split their voucher of 50 &euro;, they both won a voucher of 25 &euro;. That means with a voucher of 30 &euro; I won the biggest value ;-)
