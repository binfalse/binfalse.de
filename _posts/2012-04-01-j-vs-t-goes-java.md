I just ported the Jabber -vs- Twitter bridge to Java.


That was a point on my todo list for a long time, because I hate the hacked stuff from the improvised Perl solution. And in the end I finally did it ;-)

You can find the new <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> to <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> bridge with the name <a href="/software/xtb/">XTB</a> in my sidebar. It's now written in nice Java code, easy to understand and much easier to work with! So feel free to give it a try!

End of announcement! :P
