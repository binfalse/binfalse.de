Today a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/binfalse/status/90098354041790464">great</a> mails arrived at my inbox. In one of them I was reading <em>I've just added your feed to the site</em>.

<h2>Where did this mail come from?</h2>
The sender of the email was <a href="http://www.talgalili.com/">Tal Galili</a>. He is a researcher in BioStatistics at the Tel Aviv University, very <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">active</a> <a href="http://www.talgalili.com/">around</a> <a href="http://biostatistics.co.il/">the</a> <a href="http://www.r-statistics.com/">internet</a>. He also originated <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-Bloggers</a> and in this email he told me that I'm recruited ;-)

<h2>What is R-Bloggers</h2>
R-Bloggers is an aggregation of more than 200 bloggers writing about <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">GNU's R</a> and some statistics/math/hacks that can be done using R. If you didn't heard about R-Bloggers I strongly recommend to take a look at their website. I'm following this project since a while, it's a great fusion of brainiacs! So I'm proud to have my modest R-related articles listed between them.

Btw. if you like R-Bloggers and/or have some R experiences yet you should also take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming">'R' programming Wikibook</a>. Contributing your knowledge is greatly appreciated!

Let's see what the future brings, happy hacking!
