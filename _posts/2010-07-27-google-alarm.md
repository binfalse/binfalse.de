Just found it on <a href="http://fffff.at/">F.A.T.</a>, a Firefox plugin called <a href="http://fffff.at/google-alarm/">google-alarm</a>! Look at this tool and recognize how much information you expose by simple surfing.

To make it work on my Iceweasel 3.5.11 I had to change the  `em:minVersion`  in the  `install.rdf`  of the  `.xpi`  archive. It's just for noticing, I don't provide this changed version because you should not download such things from sites like mine ;)

You should also take a look at <a href="http://fffff.at/">F.A.T.</a>, they often have smart projects!
