Oh no, not that kind of quickie you might think about! Rumpel an me decided more or less spontaneously to go to Bonn and visit one of our <a href="http://meet-unix.org/">former employee Martin</a> and additionally take a little look at <a href="https://events.ccc.de/sigint/2010/wiki/Hauptseite">SIGINT</a> in Cologne.

So we rent a car at <a href="http://www.sixt.de/">Sixt</a> on Friday morning and met Martin at 5 pm in his flat. Of course our trip was very analog, we didn't have any navigation device, just printed a route calculated by Google maps and rely to male instinct on the way through Germany and the high traffic in Ruhr Valley at Friday afternoon before holiday... What should I say, of course everything went totally well and we had a lot of fun in our little car!

Of course it was a great weekend! We've seen a lot of fascination places of Bonn and Cologne like Cologne cathedral, big ships on Rhine or Media Center in Cologne. The events at SIGINT were also interesting, where it cannot be compared with the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/">Chaos Communcation Congress</a> in Berlin. In Cologne you'll always get a chair and the queues are very short. Nevertheless the topics are of high quality.

All in all it was an excellent trip, even it was very expensive.
