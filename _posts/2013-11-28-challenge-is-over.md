About 6 or 10 moths ago we were searching for a student to work with us in the <a href="http://sems.uni-rostock.de/">SEMS project</a>. In order to reduce the number of applications I started a challenge. To solve this challenge you had to show some understanding for basic techniques and programming languages, so we didn't waste our time with people not able to write a single line of source code.



And what should I say? It was successful! We're now a great team with three students :D

However, currently this challenge seems to spread over the internet. And lot's of people try to solve it (and many submit a wrong answer^^). But even worse, some of you guys try to exploit it by submitting something like



{% highlight bash %}
"; SHOW TABLES;
{% endhighlight %}



In general I don't care. It was just some lines of PHP that send me an email in case of a correct answer. There is no database and the worst that can happen is a full inbox, but now I decided to close this challenge and instead forward users to this article.

Thus, if you arrive here feel free to apply for a job! I guess all of my readers, even if they didn't solve this challenge, are perfect fellows...

If you nevertheless want to give it a try you can <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/challenge-sems.pdf">download the challenge</a>.
