Last year, I participated in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge and used that opportunity to dig a bit into the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) universe.
That was quite a morish adventure, and to continue on that journey I was looking for small but practically "problems" that can be solved using rust.
Under the supervision of an artificial and a natural intelligence, it all started with text recognition in images, followed by a lot of parallel computing (which is really nice in rust!), crawlers, web services, a bit of web assembly, etc...  

And accidentally, half a year later a usable tool emerged:

#### MEUN: Rostock's largest furniture exchange and upcycling network.


On an interactive map at [meun.codeahoi.de](https://meun.codeahoi.de) users can find all kinds of gems in urban regions, such as Sperrm√ºll (eg. old furniture or e-waste) and places to share books and clothes.
Currently, MEUN focuses on the Rostock region, but there is no technical limitation -- it's simply the region I'm most familiar with ;-)

### Technical highlights

MEUN stores it's data in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), extended with [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) for support with geographic data.
The backend service is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) framework.
Users can register with an email address - there are no passwords in the classical sense.
If you register or if you want to login MEUN will send a random one-time password per email, which is valid for an hour.
Sessions are realised using [axum_sessions](https://docs.rs/axum-sessions/latest/axum_sessions/#).
However, the whole "platform" is designed to not require any logins.
You can just open [MEUN](https://meun.codeahoi.de) and start browsing through points of interest and create new ones if you discover gems in your urban digressions.

The background vector tiles come from [Maptiler](https://www.maptiler.com/).
I also use other Maptiler features, such as the coordinate-to-address lookup.
MEUN's PostGIS map data is served by [Tegola](https://tegola.io/).
The frontend is developed in [Angular](https://angular.io/).
The map is integrated using [ngx-maplibre-gl](https://maplibre.org/ngx-maplibre-gl/) and the client state is managed with [Elf](https://ngneat.github.io/elf/).


Finally, I need to emphasise that I did not realise all that alone.
I never did something useful with Rust before and I haven't had much experience with geographic information systems (GIS), so I'm really that I received a lot of help by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)!
Not only with the programming, but also with wording and brainstorming and even the acronym.
Without ChatGPT, I would never have thought of building **"Rostock's largest furniture exchange and upcycling network!"** ;-)  
In addition, I received similarly important supervision by my non-AI friend and Rust expert [Martin](https://martinpeters.tech/)!


I learnt a lot and had tons of fun with my friends.
And maybe you find that tool useful as well?

If you have cool ideas on how to improve/extend it or if you find other use cases for such a GIS platform, please let me know.
Here as a comment, via email, or through the comment feature on [MEUN](https://meun.codeahoi.de).
