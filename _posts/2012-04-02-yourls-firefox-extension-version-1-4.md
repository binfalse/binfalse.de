I submitted a new version of the <a href="/software/yourls-firefox-extension/">YOURLS Firefox extension</a>.


It just contains some minor changes, but I want to inform my loyal readers!
The add-on is currently in the review queue, hopefully this time I'll get a complete review by the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">AMO</a>-team ;-)

If you're crazy you can try the new version, it's available on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/yourls-firefox/files/yourls-shortener-1.4.xpi/download">SourceForge</a> and on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yourls-shortener/versions/">AMO</a>.

<strong>UPDATE:</strong>
I just received a fully review, so my add-on is finally stable!!
