Some notes to setup my monitoring plugins.



<h2>Dependencies</h2>
My plugins come with some dependencies. I'm trying to list them on their website, but sometimes I forget something considered to be obvious. Please notify me if you run into trouble.
Most of the plugins also expect to find the  `utils.pm`  and  `utils.sh`  in  `/usr/lib/nagios/plugins`  (Debian style). If these files are located somewhere else on your machine, you might need to adjust the path in the source. Feel free to <a href="/contact/">ping</a> me if you need some help!

<h2>Embedding into Nagios/Icinga</h2>
In the following I suppose you have Icinga or Nagios installed. Otherwise I recommend to read the instructions of the software you are using.
<h3>Setup with NRPE</h3>
On you monitoring server you need to create a service section like:



{% highlight bash %}
define service {
	host_name			YOUR_CLIENT
	service_description	YOUR_DESCRIPTION
	check_command		check_nrpe!SAMPLE_COMMAND
	use					generic-service
}
{% endhighlight %}



On the client you also have to define the command  `SAMPLE_COMMAND` , for example:



{% highlight bash %}
command[SAMPLE_COMMAND]=/path/to/the/plugin arguments
{% endhighlight %}



<h3>Setup on the monitoring server itself</h3>
If you want to run the plugin on your monitoring server itself, you need to create a command that executes the plugin:



{% highlight bash %}
define command {
	command_name	SAMPLE_COMMAND
	command_line	/path/to/the/plugin arguments
}
{% endhighlight %}



And also create a service section like:



{% highlight bash %}
define service {
	host_name			localhost
	service_description	YOUR_DESCRIPTION
	check_command		SAMPLE_COMMAND!ARGUMENTS
	use					generic-service
}
{% endhighlight %}



<h3>Disclamer</h3>
These installation instructions are just for copy&paste supposes. If you've never heard about Icinga I recommend to read some <a href="https://wiki.icinga.org/">basic documents</a> ;-)
