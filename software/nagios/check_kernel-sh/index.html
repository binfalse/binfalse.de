A <a href="http://www.nagios.com/">Nagios</a>-plugin to check if a machine is running the latest kernel.

It basically compares the output of `uname -r` with available `/boot/vmlinuz-*` files, so it should be somewhat generic and is supposed to work for most linux based systems. Let me know if it's not working for you.
The script doesn't expect any arguments.

<a href='/wp-content/uploads/pipapo/monitoring/check_kernel.sh'>Here is the code</a>:

{% highlight bash %}
current_kernel=$(uname -r)
latest_kernel=$(find /boot/ -name vmlinuz-* | sort -V | tail -1 | sed 's/.*vmlinuz-//')

if [ "$current_kernel" = "$latest_kernel" ]
then
    echo "running kernel is $current_kernel"
    exit ${STATE_OK}
else
    echo "your kernel $current_kernel is outdated, please boot into $latest_kernel"
    exit ${STATE_WARNING}
fi
{% endhighlight %}
