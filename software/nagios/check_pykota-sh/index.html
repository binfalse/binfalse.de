This script checks whether <a href="http://www.PyKota.com/">PyKota</a> is running.

Our print accounting is managed with PyKota. Sometimes when we update Phyton or PyKota itself it afterwards doesn't run as expected. To contemporary get informed about this problem I wrote this script to check whether PyKota is running.

<a href='/wp-content/uploads/pipapo/monitoring/check_pykota.sh'>Here is the code</a>.

Please consider to take a look at my <a href="/software/nagios/plugin-setup-notes/">general setup notes</a>.
