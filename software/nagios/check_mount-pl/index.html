A <a href="http://www.nagios.com/">Nagios</a>-plugin to check if a device is mounted.

Those of you that have a bigger NFS infrastructure may know the problem, that some shares may unmount itself or won't be mount correctly after reboot. This plugin checks whether a device a mounted on a specific mount point.

To run it just give it the mount point you're looking for:


{% highlight bash %}
USAGE: ./check_mount.pl
        -m MOUNTPOINT   wich mountpoint to check
        [-t TYPE]       optionally check whether it's this kind of fs-type
{% endhighlight %}


If you additionally define which mount type you expect, this plugin will check whether your expectation matches. Just try it out ;)
Maybe you have to modify the location of your  `utils.pm`  by updating the  `lib` -path in line 13.
