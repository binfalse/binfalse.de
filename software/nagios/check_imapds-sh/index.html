This script checks the number of imap-deamons and warns if it reaches the maximum number.

We had some problems with the number of imap-deamons, so I wrote this small script. It parses the <a href="http://www.courier-mta.org/">Courier</a> configuration file located in  `/etc/courier/imapd-ssl`  and warns if only 5 deamons are left and alerts if the maximum number is reached.
