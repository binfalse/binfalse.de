title: Apt-Repo

---

I'm maintaining an apt repo (using [reprepro](https://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org/)).
Just create a file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/binfalse.list`
containing the following:

    deb http://apt.binfalse.de binfalse main

For those as lazy as me:

    sudo echo "deb http://apt.binfalse.de binfalse main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/binfalse.list

All packages I provide are prefixed with `bf-`.
