MS-Mapper is a Java application, designed to create 2D-heatmaps of mass spectrometry data.

The current version just understands <a href="http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Formats:mzXML">MZXML</a> data, so you might need to convert your proprietary file formats first.
You can choose between different color maps, e.g. <strong>heat</strong> colors or a <strong>gray</strong> scale. It also supports various scaling: <strong>logarithmic</strong> scale, scale by <strong>square root</strong> and no scaling at all. In addition the figure can be surrounded by a <strong>legend</strong>. At the moment only images in PNG format are supported, if you are interested in different image formats feel free to file a feature request. Image dimensions are determined by the user.
A resulting image with heat colors, a logarithm scale and surrounded legends is displayed in figure 1.

The graphical user interface should be easy to understand, a screen-shot is attached in figure 2. If you anyway need help feel free to <a href="/contact/">ping</a> me.
All you need to run it is a Java runtime environment, you can get one for free from <a href="http://java.com/">java.com</a>.
