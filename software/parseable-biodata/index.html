title: 'ParseAble BioData'

Biorelated data to parse within different projects.


It's often hard to find raw data files that are easy to parse. To create it by hand is very annoying, so here are some parse-able raw data sets!

Feel free to use it by your own projects, and of course feel free to send me your data sets, I'll host it for public availability!

<dl>
<dt><a href="/software/parseable-biodata/amino-acids/">Amino acids</a></dt>
<dd>Raw data of amino acids.</dd>
<dt><a href="/software/parseable-biodata/isotopic-distributions/">Isotopic distributions</a></dt>
<dd>Raw isotope data</dd>
</dl>

Please keep in mind that these files may be adjusted at any time, so take care to update them by your own! There is no guarantee for correctness!

<strong>If you have additional information to update or extend the data please inform me! I'm always interested to provide it.</strong>
