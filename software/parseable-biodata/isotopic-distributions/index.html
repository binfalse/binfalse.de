List of stable isotopes to parse within your tools.


Here are more or less all stable isotopes.
If you have additional information to update or extend the data please inform me! I'm interested in providing it.

The following information is tab-separated:
<ul>
	<li>Atomic number 	 	 	 	</li>
	<li>Name</li>
	<li>Symbol</li>
	<li>Electronegativity (Pauling scale)</li>
	<li>White space separated list of abundance,mass</li>
</ul>

Here is a sample of the file:


{% highlight bash %}
6	Carbon	C	2.55	0.9893,12.0	0.0107,13.0033548378
{% endhighlight %}



Please keep in mind that these files may be adjusted at any time, so take care to update them by your own! There is no guarantee for correctness!
