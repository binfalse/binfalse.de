It was first developed in a little group of three student as a project in the third semester of our bioinformatics study at the <a href="http://www.uni-halle.de">Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg</a>. This team contained:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Martin Scharm</li>
	<li>Christoph Ruttkies</li>
	<li>Steffi Dornfeldt</li>
</ul>

The first version from year 2007 was revived in 2011 by myself to delete some bugs and add some special new features. All versions are available in the Download section.
