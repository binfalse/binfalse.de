A <a href="http://www.nagios.com/">Nagios</a>-plugin to monitor fail-counts of <a href="http://wiki.openvz.org/Main_Page">OpenVZ</a> containers.

OpenVZ containers may have limited resources, if they reach their maximum and try to request more of a single resource they produce a <em>fail-count</em> that is displayed in  `/proc/user_beancounters` . Maybe you want to get notified about that problem, this script monitors the file and alerts if any fail-counter increases.
To reset the fail-counts you have to restart the container, but sometimes there isn't the chance to reboot a virtual machine. So this script copies the  `/proc/user_beancounters`  (at default the copy is located at  `/tmp/user_beancounters` ) and alerts about diffs. To disable the alert just delete the copy, the script will create a new copy when it is called the next time. So there won't be a diff anymore.

To get read access to  `/proc/user_beancounters`  for the user  `nagios`  don't forget to set the  `s` -bit ( `chmod +s check_UBC.pl` ).
