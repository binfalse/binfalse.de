Since a while the <a href="http://www.3sat.de/mediathek/">mediathek of 3sat</a> doesn't work correctly for me.



{% include image.html align="alignright" url="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/3sat-mediathek-broken.png" img="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/3sat-mediathek-broken-150x150.png" title="" caption="" %}

On the player's site, I cannot reach the direct download-link, because other div's cover it... You can see it in the screen-shot.

Because I don't like that plugin-stuff, the media object is really senseless for and so I can shrink it that the link becomes visible. The method is clear: UserScript!

<a href='/wp-content/uploads/pipapo/user-scripts/3sat-repair.user.js'>Here is the code</a>:

[cc lang="javascript" file="pipapo/user-scripts/3sat-repair.user.js"][/cc]

{% include image.html align="alignright" url="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/3sat-mediathek-repaired.png" img="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/3sat-mediathek-repaired-150x150.png" title="" caption="" %}

With this small piece of code the link becomes reachable and it is on that position where the mouse-pointer should hang around when you have left the previous site ;)
