title: 'SquirrelMail search reorder'

---

Resort the search results of <a href="http://squirrelmail.org/index.php">SquirrelMail</a>.


The search results of SquirrelMail are ordered from the oldest to the newest mail. But you probably often search for the newest mail, and so every time you perform a search you have to scroll to the bottom of the page...

This userscript resorts all mails, so that the newest mail is on the top of the page! A description of the functionality you can find in the <a href="/2010/10/resort-search-results-in-squirrelmail/">corresponding blog article</a>.

<a href='/wp-content/uploads/pipapo/user-scripts/squirrelmail_search_reorder.user.js'>Here is the code</a>:
