Fight against your forgetfulness with a small bash script!


This script helps you remembering periodical dates like birthdays, (wedding) anniversary or anything like this. All you need is a configured mail server and the <a href="http://www.bsd.org/">BSD</a> tool <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=calendar&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+8.1-RELEASE&format=html">calendar</a> (most likely installed on your system).
Just set up a file with all your important dates (check out syntax restriction in man-page), here is a small example:



{% highlight bash %}
LANG=utf-8
#include <calendar.german>

01/01	happy new year
10/17	uschy
Oct 27	martin
Nov. 28	anybody else
{% endhighlight %}



Now replace the contents of the variables in the script and create a cronjob that runs the file once a day. So you'll probably don't miss further birthdays anymore!
