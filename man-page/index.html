This is the site's man-page. Here you'll find some general terms and conditions and legal notices.

## 1. Who Am I

My name is **Martin Scharm** from Rostock, doing my PhD at the [Dept. of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics](http://www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/) at the [University of Rostock](http://www.uni-rostock.de/). I am keen on programming and administrating linux\|unix systems and I like information. And that is what this site is about. 
<!--One of my special interests is programming and administration.-->

This blog is about my work, studies and life! Here I jot down some notes about what I just learned to not forget about it right away. It's something like a collection of various stuff concerning bioinformatics, hacking, and\|or $stuff. The content on this website is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Most of the software I developed is assembled in repositories at [GitHub](https://github.com/binfalse) or [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/u/bin-false/profile/). Let free software rule the world!

If you're interested in learning more about me you might want to have a look at my [curriculum vitae](http://cv.binfalse.de/).

Neither me nor any third parties provide any warranty or guarantee as to the accuracy, timeliness, performance, completeness or suitability of the information and materials found or offered on this website for any particular purpose. You acknowledge that such information and materials may contain inaccuracies or errors and I expressly exclude liability for any such inaccuracies or errors to the fullest extent permitted by law.

If you find any bugs or have feature request feel free to report them at my <a href="https://bt.binfalse.de/">issue tracking system</a>.
From time to time this website may also include links to other websites. These links are provided for your convenience to provide further information. They do not signify that I endorse the website(s). I have no responsibility for the content of the linked website(s).

## 4. Privacy
I am committed to safeguarding the privacy of my website visitors.
I may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal information:
<ul>
	<li>information about your visits to and use of this website (including referral source and website navigation)</li>
	<li>information that you provide to me for the purpose of interacting with me (your name, website and email address)</li>
	<li>any other information that you choose to send to us</li>
</ul>

### 4.a Cookies
A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.  
I use so called <em>session cookies</em> and <em>persistent cookies</em> on the website to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website and to enable my website to recognize you when you visit.
Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.

### 4.b Using your personal information
I may use your personal information to:
<ul>
	<li>administer the website</li>
	<li>deal with enquiries and complaints made by or about you relating to the website</li>
</ul>
I will never ever publish your personal information or provide them to any third parties.

### 4.c Searching through DuckDuckGo

Searching through this static website is facilitated through <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>.
If you enter a search term to one of the search fields and hit enter (or the click the `Search` button) you will be redirected to the search engine DuckDuckGo.
Thus, your browser will be sending certain information about your visit, your search request, and other personal information to the webserver of DuckDuckGo.
Before searching, you should read <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">DuckDuckGo's privacy policy</a>.

It is still hard to trust what they are doing with that information.
If you have doubts you should use a search engine that you trust more.
My search field basically redirects the user to search for `site:binfalse.de test` at DuckDuckGo.
This should also be possible with any other search engine.

There is a special note near every search field to remind you of the privacy concerns.


### 4.d Embedding of OpenStreetMap

On some pages I embed maps of OpenStreetMap.
OpenStreetMap is provided by the [OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF)](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page), based on the [Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/index.html).
To display the maps, map tiles need to be downloaded from OpenStreetMap.org.
Thus, you will send personal data to the servers of the OSMF.
To prohibit unwanted data leakage and to remind visitors of the implications, the maps are initially replaced by placeholders: Only after a separate confirmation the maps will be downloaded.
More information is available from the privacy policy of the OSMF: [wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy).




### 4.e Policy amendments
I may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version on my website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes.


## 5. Contact
If you have any questions about this policies or our treatment of your personal information, please feel free to <a href="/contact/">ping me</a>.
