This is the site's man-page. Here you'll find some general terms and conditions and legal notices.

## 1. Who Am I

My name is **Martin Scharm** from Rostock, doing my PhD at the [Dept. of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics](http://www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/) at the [University of Rostock](http://www.uni-rostock.de/). I am keen on programming and administrating linux\|unix systems and I like information. And that is what this site is about. 
<!--One of my special interests is programming and administration.-->

This blog is about my work, studies and life! Here I jot down some notes about what I just learned to not forget about it right away. It's something like a collection of various stuff concerning bioinformatics, hacking, and\|or $stuff. The content on this website is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Most of the software I developed is assembled in repositories at [GitHub](https://github.com/binfalse) or [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/u/bin-false/profile/). Let free software rule the world!

If you're interested in learning more about me you might want to have a look at my [curriculum vitae](http://cv.binfalse.de/).

### 4.c Searching through DuckDuckGo

Searching through this static website is facilitated through <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>.
If you enter a search term to one of the search fields and hit enter (or the click the `Search` button) you will be redirected to the search engine DuckDuckGo.
Thus, your browser will be sending certain information about your visit, your search request, and other personal information to the webserver of DuckDuckGo.
Before searching, you should read <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">DuckDuckGo's privacy policy</a>.

It is still hard to trust what they are doing with that information.
If you have doubts you should use a search engine that you trust more.
My search field basically redirects the user to search for `site:binfalse.de test` at DuckDuckGo.
This should also be possible with any other search engine.

There is a special note near every search field to remind you of the privacy concerns.
