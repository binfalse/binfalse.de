message: "Thanks so much for posting this, Mr Scharm! It really saved me a lot of
  time, since I am not that faimilar with the WordPress structure yet. In my version,
  hey aren&#39;t at the exact line numbers cited here, but are easy to find with a
  search for the words.\n\nFor a new site where few tags had been used yet, I wanted
  to see them all, even if unused, and also do not like the &quot;filter bubble&quot;
  effect of ordering by popularity. I include the parameters to achieve these changes
  to save someone else the trouble of looking them up:\n\n     `$tags = get_terms(
  $taxonomy, array( 'number' => 999, 'orderby' => 'name', 'order' => 'DESC' , 'hide_empty'=>
  false) );`\n\nCordially,\nB. Magilavy"
