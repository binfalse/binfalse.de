message: 'Hi Martin, thanks so much for this. Is there a way to expand on your method
  to also do the following:

  Can it also show empty tags (ie. that are not being used by any posts)? It only
  shows tags that are used by posts, even if they are in your tags database.


  Thanks again Martin.'
