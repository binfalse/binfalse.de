message: 'Thank you very much for the shadow file clue.  Mine was both owned and group
  root and mode 400 (read only, root only).  Changed it to group shadow and mode 640
  (read,write root and read shadow).  Now I can unlock with xtrlock and xscreenlock
  using shadow passwords.  Like you, I have NO IDEA how the permissions and group
  were altered to begin with.  May be legacy since the OS has been upgraded many times.


  Google search does not bring up your solution.  Thanks again.
