message: 'I got the MFC-9320CW and got it working as a printer over wireless so far.
  CUPS gave me two automatically detected printers to choose from, one had a dnssd
  URL and one had an lpd URL. I couldn''t get the dnssd one to work at all but the
  lpd one works fine.


  The working url is lpd://Brother/BINARY_P1


  To try scanning next.


  Also, how do I get it to do B&amp;W? I don''t always want to print in colour!'
