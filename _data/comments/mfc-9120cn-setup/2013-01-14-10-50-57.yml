message: "Hi, Thanks for an interesting and well written post. I consider the same
  printer myself, but have found many forum posts indicating that it is not at all
  straightforward to get this up and running on linux..\n\nHow come this works well
  when the printer is not listed by Cups compatible devices? \nhttp://www.cups.org/ppd.php\n\nWhere
  did you find proof in your research before buying, that this would work in linux?\n\nkind
  regards,\natle weibell"
