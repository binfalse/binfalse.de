message: "First off, sane exiting from the usage statement, in the event someone adds
  a check, but forgets the mount point..\n\n\n\n\tsub how_to\n\t{\n\t\tprint
  \"USAGE: $0\\n\\t-m MOUNTPOINT\\twich mountpoint to check\\n\\t[-t TYPE]\\toptionally
  check whether it's this kind of fs-type\\n\\n\";\n\t\tprint \"OK: We really have no
  idea what you want to check, so we'll play it safe here, alright?\\n\";\n\t\texit
  $ERRORS{'OK'};\n\t}\n\n\n\nIn case of a mount point sitting under
  another like this:\n\n\n\n\t/opt/something mounted from /dev/sdb\n\t/opt/something/shared
  mounted from NFS\n\n\n\nthen you actually catch both in your
  $erg grep ... To only catch the one filesystem you are looking for is doing something
  like this (ugly) hack ..\n\n\n\n\tmy $erg = `mount | grep $MOUNT
  | awk '{ print \\$3\\\" \\\"\\$5 }' | grep -v ^$MOUNT\\/`;\n\tchomp $erg; #I tend
  to get rid of newlines ...\n\n\n\nAlso CIFS mounts may lose
  connectivity to the server sharing the folder, but will recover on its own. In the
  meantime you'll not be able (of course) to do anything with data in that mountpoint.
  What distinguishes things is simply a directory listing which will contain nothing
  but a number of question marks if you do a long listing ( `ls -l` ) ..\n\n\n\n\tuser@host $ ll /opt/some_dir\n\ttotal 0\n\t?--------- ? ? ? ?            ?
  another_dir\n\n\n\nSo, I've added a little bit of code, for
  this specific case (and changed a regexp along the way) ...\n\n\n\n\tif ($erg)\n\t{\n\t\tif (defined ($TYPE))\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif ($erg =~ m/$TYPE/x)\n\t\t\t{
  if ($TYPE eq \"cifs\") {\n\t\t\t\tmy $fs_listing = `ls -larth $MOUNT`;\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tif
  ($fs_listing =~ m/\\?/x) {\n\t\t\t\t\tprint \"WARNING: \" . $MOUNT . \" is mounted
  but we cannot access files!!\\n\";\n\t\t\t\t\texit $ERRORS{'WARNING'};\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\n\t\t\t\tprint
  \"OK: \" . $MOUNT . \" is mounted! Type is \" . $TYPE . \"\\n\";\n\t\t\t\texit $ERRORS{'OK'};\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tprint
  \"WARNING: \" . $MOUNT . \" is mounted! But type is not \" . $TYPE . \"\\n\";\n\t\t\t\texit
  $ERRORS{'WARNING'};\n\t\t\t}\n\t}\n\t\tprint \"OK: \" . $MOUNT . \" is mounted!\\n\";\n\t\texit
  $ERRORS{'OK'};\n\t}\n\n\n\nAppears to be working nicely during
  initial tests. YMMV..."
