message: 'Hi,

  is there a way to get error messages from R back?


  - CODE EXAMPLE:

  Rengine rEngine = new Rengine(new String [] {"--vanilla"}, false, null);

  rEngine.eval("library(xts)");

  rEngine.assign("arrayValue", DOUBLE DATA);

  rEngine.assign("arrayDates", DOUBLE DATA);

  rEngine.eval("test = xts(arrayValue, order.by=arrayDates)");


  The last statement not only takes 1 minute to run, it also seems to fail (no test
  variable is created)

  -&gt; Is there a way to get some log information?


  Thank you and best regards!'
