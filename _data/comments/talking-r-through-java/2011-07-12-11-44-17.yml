message: 'When I execute within R the command  `library(RODBC)`  it works.

  I just see I have  `/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RODBC/libs/RODBC.so`  (I suppose
  that is the library is required).

  What is the  `JRI.jar`  version you are using? I have not got the  `parseAndEval`  method.

  Thanks again'
