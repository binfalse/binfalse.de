message: 'Greetings,

  Now my Java-R connection works, I can make some calculus. But I do not know how
  I can use R''s libraries like RODBC through Java, I tried with:   `re.eval("library(RODBC)")`
  , that did not work. Can you help me to use this library? How can I test the library
  is actually loaded?

  Thanks'
