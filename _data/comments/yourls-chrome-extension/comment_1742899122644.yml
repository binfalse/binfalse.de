  My programmer is trying to persuade me to move to .net from PHP. I have always
  disliked the idea because of the costs. But he's tryiong none the less. I've
  been using WordPress on numerous websites for about a year and am anxious
  about switching to another platform. I have heard very good things about
  blogengine.net. Is there a way I can transfer all my wordpress content into
  it? Any kind of help would be greatly appreciated!
