message: "I'm not sure how you're going to deploy the extension automatically!? However,
  as far as i know you either:\n\n<ul>\n<li>need to configure each browser individually
  in order to setup URL and signature according to your YOURLS server (in that case
  it's not that much more effort to also tick the corresponding checkbox)</li>\n<li>or
  you need to modify the sources. This plugin is open source, feel free to clone/fork
  it from GitHub and include your defaults.</li>\n</ul>\n\nOne option to define defaults
  is substituting the function  `RestoreOptions`  (defined in <a href=\"https://github.com/binfalse/YOURLS-ChromeExtension/blob/master/js/options.js#L27\">
  js/options.js</a>) with:\n\n\n\n\tfunction RestoreOptions
  ()\n\t{\n\tvar url   = document.getElementById ('url');\n\tvar secret = document.getElementById
  ('secret');\n\tvar keyword = document.getElementById ('keyword');\n\tvar wait =
  document.getElementById ('wait');\n\t\t\n\t\tif (typeof localStorage['yourls_url'] ==
  'undefined')\n\t\t\tlocalStorage['yourls_url'] = \">>> default url <<<\";\n\t\tif (typeof
  localStorage['yourls_secret'] == 'undefined')\n\t\t\tlocalStorage['yourls_secret']
  = \">>> default secret <<<\";\n\t\tif (typeof localStorage['yourls_keyword'] == 'undefined')\n\t\t\tlocalStorage['yourls_keyword']
  = \">>> default use keyword <<<\"; // you probably want to set this to true\n\t\tif
  (typeof localStorage['yourls_wait'] == 'undefined')\n\t\t\tlocalStorage['yourls_wait']
  = \">>> default wait time <<<\";\n\t\t\n\t\twait.value = localStorage['yourls_wait'];\n\t\turl.value
  \  = localStorage['yourls_url'];\n\t\tsecret.value = localStorage['yourls_secret'];\n\t\tkeyword.checked
  = localStorage['yourls_keyword'] === \"true\";\n\t}\n\n\n\nDoes
  this solve your problem? If you need help with building the extension I could modify
  the code and compile a customized extension just for you and your customers.!?"
