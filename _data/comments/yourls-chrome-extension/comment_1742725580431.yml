  Hey! This is kind of off topic but I need some advice from an established
  blog. Is it hard to set up your own blog? I'm not very techincal but I can
  figure things out pretty quick. I'm thinking about setting up my own but I'm
  not sure where to start. Do you have any tips or suggestions?  Thank you
