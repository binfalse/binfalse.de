  Haved used YOURLS in firefox & brave. Works great. Would like a way to tag
  links. I have many links on any topic & presently hard to find them. A input
  box (what ever) to add keyword(s) would be a big help. For example all links
  on Climate change; small engines & many more could be easily found.
