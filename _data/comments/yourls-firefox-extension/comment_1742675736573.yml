  Hey I know this is off topic but I was wondering if you knew of any widgets I
  could add to my blog that automatically tweet my newest twitter updates. I've
  been looking for a plug-in like this for quite some time and was hoping maybe
  you would have some experience with something like this. Please let me know if
  you run into anything. I truly enjoy reading your blog and I look forward to
  your new updates.
