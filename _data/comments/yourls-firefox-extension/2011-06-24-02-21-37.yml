message: "Hi there-\n\nThis is fantastic!  Two quick questions for you.  :)\n\n1.
  Am I understanding it correctly that the customization comes after the toolbar is
  installed?  \n\n2. If so...  As I understand it, this would be no bueno for public
  installations.  Is there a way to adapt this in such a way that we could, say, offer
  the extension to download from our website for other people to use?\n\nThanks and
  best wishes,\nKristen\n\nThat's a very cruel authorization method you got going
  there, btw..."
