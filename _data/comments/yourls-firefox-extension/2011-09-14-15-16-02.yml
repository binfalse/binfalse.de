message: 'Hi Ludo,


  the plugin is available for FF6 since August 21, 2011. You''ll find it <a href="http://s.binfalse.de/ffextv"
  rel="nofollow">here</a>.

  Unfortunately it has to get reviewed by the dev-team of Mozilla before you''ll find
  it on it''s main page (or in the search results). I submitted the plugin for review
  on August 21, but it''s still waiting for a review in the queue. (Currently it''s
  on position 56 of 241, after ~1 month!!). As long as it''s in this queue I cannot
  do anymore than waiting (and hoping that Mozilla extends it''s dev-team to fit it''s
  extremely shortened release cycles).


  I hope this answer helps,

  Martin'
