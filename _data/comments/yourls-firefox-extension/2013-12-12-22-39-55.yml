message: When selecting a sentence prior to clicking "Shorten", and the sentence contains
  whitespaces, the whitespaces are stripped. I would like them to be replaced by '-',
  and all upper cases to be replaced by lowercases. Similar to soundcloud and in line
  with common practice elsewhere. What's your opinion?
