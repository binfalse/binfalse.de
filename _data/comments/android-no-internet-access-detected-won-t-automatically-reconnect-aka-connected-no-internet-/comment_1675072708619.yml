message: "Good day Binfalse\r\n\r\nI happened to stumble on your website after searching everywhere for a solution.\r\n\r\nI have a Samsung Galaxy S7 with Android 8. I just want to connect it to my drone WI-FI network (which of course has no internet) but this has proven to be much more difficult than I thought.\r\n\r\nYour solution sounds like exactly what I need, but even though I tried it, it doesn't seem to work. I think its because I am not really a programmer with limited knowledge on this.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to explain to me in more detail how to solve my problem?\r\n\r\nI have managed to get the following to work:\r\n1. phone is rooted\r\n2. I can see my device from the command prompt through the ADB command \"adb devices\"\r\n3. I can access a shell through the command \"adb shell\"\r\n4. I can access SU through the command \"su\" and it adds a # to the shell. herolte:/ #\r\n\r\nFrom here I copied and pasted your code (\"setting put global captive_portal_mode 0\" and also tried \"settings put global CAPTIVE_PORTAL_MODE_IGNORE = 0\") to solve the problem but it doesn't seem to work. I also don't know what is supposed to happen after you type the code and press enter? There is no conformation and because the phone still disconnects on the drone WI-FI, it clearly did not work.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRuan"
