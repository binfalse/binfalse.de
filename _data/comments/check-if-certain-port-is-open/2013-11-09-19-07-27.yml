message: "Two alternatives come to mind. First use  `telnet`  with a port number.
  For example (using values in your example):\n\n\n\n`telnet
  1.2.3.4 1337`\n\n\n\nYou'll have to know how to close the connection
  if there is a \"Connected\" message.\n\nSecond use  `nmap`  which is something sysadmins
  should get very familiar with. Here: \n\n\n\n`nmap 1.2.3.4`"
