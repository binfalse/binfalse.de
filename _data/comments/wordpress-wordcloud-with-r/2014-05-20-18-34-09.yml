message: 'Hi Ray, thanks for your interest :)

  Unfortunately, I have no idea what might be wrong with your code. Especially if
  you do not publish it.. Moreover, it''s been some time that I developed this small
  piece of code. Thus, the R packages probably have changed their behavior?

  I hope someone else is able to help you.'
