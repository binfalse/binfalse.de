message: "Thank you!!  After over 10 days of a downed website I could almost kiss you on all four cheeks!  \r\n\r\nThat you had this problem 3 years ago is amazing but thank you very much for finding what appears to be a solution.  What I continue to not understand is how I encountered this problem.   The latest version of my website was built 3 years ago.  I have periodically updated my software but never touched the basic support package.  I am running ruby on rails with passenger on a digital ocean platform.  Nothing was changed on the website (by me) in a 2 hour period when site went to unbootable from working fine.  I have restored backups from 4 weeks ago that will no longer boot.  How can that be since, supposedly, I am restoring a copy of my whole system?\r\n\r\nMy bug (identical to what you showed) occours in passenger when it is trying to load my program.  I did not dig into your problem but it seems to be under very different circumstances.  I am now really questioning the \"illegal instruction\" error since, it appears, that you found a problem in a totally unrelated routine that supplies file names for the routine that blows up.\r\n\r\nI am also mystified as to why hundreds of other people have not reported this problem.\r\n\r\nSo, while I am very happy that you have restored my website, I actually have more questions now than I did when the problem first occoured.  In the unlikely event that I learn something useful, I will update you but, with very polite emails, both passenger and digital ocean said \"this is not my problem\"\r\n\r\nAgain, many thanks for chasing this bug down,\r\n\r\nDavid Plummer\r\n\r\ndplummer410@yahoo.com"
